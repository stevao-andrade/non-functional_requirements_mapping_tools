# non-functional_requirements_mapping

This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) aims to perform a characterization of the
current state of the art involving the types of Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) testing
approaches applied on mobile applications, allowing as well identify the challenges involved
on apply those approaches. Also, we intend to identify frameworks and tools proposed
to implement such approaches. Finally, we intend to identify gaps among NFRs software
testing and mobile applications, revealing research opportunities.
