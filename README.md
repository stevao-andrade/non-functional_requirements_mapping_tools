Some scripts used dring the conduction of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that aims to perform a characterization of the current state of the art involving the types of Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) testing approaches applied on mobile applications.

The major focus of the SLR  is to identify the challenges involved on apply those approaches. Besides to identify frameworks and tools proposed to implement such approaches, finally, to identify gaps among NFRs software testing and mobile applications, revealing research opportunities.
