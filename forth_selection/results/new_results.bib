  abstract  = {with the fast growth in emerging technologies for mobile applications, packaging solutions are being driven by advanced silicon (si) nodes technology (down to 7nm), smaller form factor package designs, efficiency enhancement and lower power consumption. the flip chip chip scale package (fccsp) has been widely adopted as the solution for mobile devices to satisfy these challenging requirements. in order to create a lower cost solution, the fccsp uses the cost-effective combination of copper (cu) pillar bumps, embedded trace substrate (ets) technology, mass reflow (mr) chip attach and molded underfill (muf) processes. although the utilization of mr chip attach is a cost-effective process for flip chip package assembly, there is a high risk for a bump to trace short, especially for the designs with finer bump pitch and line width / line spacing (lw/ls) with an escaped trace. to reduce this risk, the laser assisted bonding (lab) methodology is introduced to study the 7nm chip-package interaction (cpi) of an fccsp with a 60μm bump pitch and escaped traces design in this paper. for the purpose of measuring the extremely low-k (elk) performance in a 14x14mm fine pitch fccsp with 7nm live die, the thunder test (two-times mr and quick temperature cycling (qtc) tests) as well as the hammer test with multi-reflow process (peak temperature at 260oc) have been evaluated after performing lab and mr chip attach methodologies. the results show that although both chip attach methodologies can pass the normal requirements of the thunder and hammer tests, the utilization of lab technology can further enhance the strength of elk and produce better yield performance. from these results, it is believed that lab not only can guarantee assembly yield with less elk damage risk in the examined 7nm fccsp, but can also accommodate si node and bump pitch reduction with a finer lw/ls substrate with escaped traces design.},

  abstract  = {a 20nm high-κ metal-gate planar cmos technology is optimized and developed for soc platform applications that span a wide range of power and performance. this technology is based on a 20nm soc process featuring high-κ metal gate and strain techniques for core logic transistors with low-power/high-performance and i/o transistors. a high-density and a high-performance embedded memory bit cell each has an area <;0.1μm2. this technology is targeted to high-density low-cost low-power high-performance applications, such as mobile applications with video. increased threshold-voltage variation of scaled transistors reduces the static noise margin (snm) and write margin (wm) of the sram bit cell. the effect is more predominant for the high-density srams due to small device sizes and large memory capacity requirement for modern soc design. therefore, chip performance and minimum operating voltage (vddmin) are both degraded by the embedded sram. reducing the pass-gate strength or bl capacitance with slow wl rise are effective techniques to improve the sram cell stability [1,2]. underdriving the pass-gate reduces the bit-cell read current but also reduces wm, resulting in sram performance degradation. physically shortening the bl limits the sram array configuration. lowering the sram cell power supply improves the wm [3,4], but is less effective than the negative-bitline-based write-assist technique. compared to conventional techniques, this work presents a partially suppressed wordline (pswl) scheme for read assist and a bitline-length-tracked negative-bitline-boosting (bt-nbl) scheme for write assist without significantly degrading sram performance. with the read/write assist circuitry, the overall vddmin improvement is over 200mv in a 112mb sram test-chip.},

  abstract  = {in numerous mobile applications involving complex video, image, signal, communication or security processing, massive parallelism is mainly in the form of data-level parallelism (dlp). however, the sorts and amount of dlp parallelism in applications vary due to different computational characteristics of applications. on the contrary, most of the processors today include single-width simd (vector) hardware to exploit dlp. however, single-width simd architectures may not be optimal to serve applications with varying dlp and they may cause performance and energy inefficiency. we propose the usage of vliw processors with multiple native vector-widths to better serve applications with changing dlp. this paper focuses on the short simd code generation. more specifically, we target generating 32-bit simd code for the native 32-bit wide vector units of our example processor. in this way, we improved the performance of compiler generated simd code by reducing the number of overhead operations. experimental results demonstrated that our methodology implemented in the compiler reduces the number of operations of synthetic benchmarks up to 40%.},

  abstract  = {mobile application development has emerged as one of the most focused areas in software industry due to exponential growth of mobile users and applications. the focus of the current mobile industry is on direct implementation, rather than analysis and design. model-driven engineering practices are ignored, which results in low reusability and lack of portability along with other challenges. in addition, mobile applications also have to support multiple platforms, as an application written for one platform (e.g., android) cannot run on another platform (e.g., windows phone). each of the platforms in turn suffers from fragmentation. this results in multiple versions of an application that need to be simultaneously maintained. this is a huge burden on the development team, both in terms of cost and effort, due to various platforms that an application supports. this paper proposes a model-driven approach to generate mobile applications for multiple platforms. we carefully identify a subset of uml and propose a modeling methodology for this purpose. we use real use-cases for requirement gathering, class diagram for structural modeling, while state machine are used for behavioral modeling. we focus on modeling business logic layer for the mobile application. we also propose a uml profile for modeling mobile domain specific concepts. our approach uses action language for foundational subset of uml (alf) to specify actions in the state machines. our approach allows the modeler to automatically generate business logic code for multiple platforms. the approach is supported by an automated tool mag (mobile application generator). we apply our model-driven approach on an industrial case study 'scramble' app developed by 'next in' to demonstrate its viability.},

  abstract = {we propose a novel hybrid method to analyze the security vulnerabilities in android applications. our method combines static analysis, which consists of metadata and data flow analyses with dynamic analysis, which includes dynamic executable scripts and application program interface hooks. our hybrid method can effectively analyze nine major categories of important security vulnerabilities in android applications. we design dynamic executable scripts that record and perform manual operations to customize the execution path of the target application. our dynamic executable scripts can replace most manual operations, simplify the analysis process, and further verify the corresponding security vulnerabilities. we successfully statically analyze 5547 malwares in drebin and 10151 real-world applications. the average analysis time of each application in drebin is 4.52 s, whereas it reaches 92.02 s for real-word applications. our system can detect all the labeled vulnerabilities among 56 labeled applications. further dynamic verification shows that our static analysis accuracy approximates 95% for real-world applications. experiments show that our dynamic analysis can effectively detect the vulnerability named input unverified, which is difficult to be detected by other methods. in addition, our dynamic analysis can be extended to detect more types of vulnerabilities.},

  abstract  = {while numerous flaws have been recognized in using passwords as a method of authentication, passwords still remain the de-facto authentication standard in use today. though password managers can ameliorate password fatigue, the vast majority of password managers require the user to choose and maintain a strong master password while offering little to no recourse in the event that the master password is compromised. the wide-application of cloud-based password managers congregate passwords in an encrypted database, which becomes an attractive target for attackers and also represents a single point of failure. in this paper, we propose amnesia, a bilateral generative password manager that requires both the knowledge of the master password and the possession of the user's smartphone to generate website passwords for the user. our generative password manager is not vulnerable to the password database leakage, since it generates the requested password on demand using both the master password and the secret information on the smartphone. an attacker wishing to steal the user's website passwords has to compromise both the user's smartphone and the master password. amnesia also has strong recovery capability when either the master password is compromised or the smartphone is lost/stolen. by using an amnesia server, a user can have the access to the password manager on multiple computers without installing any software on those computers. we implemented an amnesia system prototype using android and cherrypy web framework and evaluated it in terms of security, usability, and overhead. a user study of 31 testers shows that amnesia increases password security while maintaining reasonable user convenience.},

  abstract = {opportunistic signals (e.g., wifi, magnetic fields, and ambient light) have been extensively studied for low-cost indoor localization, especially via fingerprinting. we present an automatic site survey approach to build the signal maps in space-constrained environments (e.g., modern office buildings). the survey can be completed by a single smartphone user during normal walking, say, with a little human intervention. our approach follows the classical graphslam framework: the front end constructs a pose graph by incorporating the relative motion constraints from the pedestrian dead-reckoning (pdr), the loop-closure constraints by magnetic sequence matching with the wifi signal similarity validation, and the global heading constraints from the opportunistic magnetic heading measurements; and the back end generates a globally consistent trajectory via graph optimization to provide ground-truth locations for the collected signal fingerprints along the survey path. we then build the signal map (also known as fingerprint database) upon these location-labeled fingerprints by the gaussian processes regression (gpr) for later online localization. specifically, we exploit the pseudowall constraints from the gpr variance map of magnetic fields and the observations of ceiling lights to correct the pdr drifts with a particle filter. we evaluate our approach on several data sets collected from both the hkust academic building and a shopping mall. we demonstrate the real-time localization on a smartphone in an office area, with 50th percentile accuracy of 2.30 m and 90th percentile accuracy of 3.41 m. note to practitioners - this paper was motivated by the problem of the efficient signal map construction for fingerprinting-based localization on smartphones. the conventional manual site survey method, known to be time-consuming and labor-intensive, hinders the penetration of fingerprinting methods in practice. this paper suggests a graphslam-based approach to automate this signal map construction process by reducing the survey overhead significantly. a surveyor is merely asked to walk through an indoor venue with an android smartphone held in hand with a little human intervention. meanwhile, opportunistic signals (e.g., wifi and magnetic fields) are captured by smartphone sensors. we construct a graphslam engine to first identify the measurement constraints from these signal observations and then recover the surveyor's walking trajectory by the graph optimization. we can generate signal maps using the captured signals alongside the recovered trajectory. in this paper, we propose a wifi signal similarity validation method to reduce false positive loop-closures and exploit the magnetic headings to improve the trajectory optimization performance. in addition, we propose to use the generated magnetic field variance map and the lights distribution map for localization. the efficacy of the proposed site survey approach is proven through field experiments, and real-time localization is demonstrated on a smartphone using the generated signal maps. the localization experiment was conducted by a single user with the same android smartphone that was used in the site survey. therefore, the usability of signal maps on other devices and the generality to other users have not yet been testified. we will leave these issues in our future work.},

  abstract = {phishing attacks have been persistent for more than two decades despite mitigation efforts from academia and industry. we believe that users fall victim to attacks not only because of lack of knowledge and awareness, but also because they are not attentive enough to security indicators and visual abnormalities on the webpages they visit. this is also probably why smart device users, who have more limited screen size and device capabilities compared to desktop users, are three times more likely to fall victim to phishing attacks. to assert our claim, we first investigated general phishing awareness among different groups of smartphone users. we then used smart eyeglasses (electro-oculographic) to experimentally measure the mental effort and vigilance exhibited by users while surfing a website and while playing an android phishing game that we developed. the results showed that knowledge and awareness about phishing do not seem to have a significant impact on security behaviours, as knowledgeable participants exhibited insecure behaviours such as opening email attachments from unfamiliar senders. however, attentiveness was important as even participants with low cybersecurity knowledge could effectively identify attacks if they were reasonably attentive. based on these results, we asserted that users are more likely to continue falling victim to phishing attacks due to insecure behaviours, unless tools to lessen the identification burden are provided. we thus recommended implementing a lightweight algorithm into a custom android browser for detecting phishing sites deceptively without a user interaction. we used fake login credentials as validation agents and monitor the destination server http responses to determine the authenticity of a webpage. we also presented initial evaluation results of this algorithm.},

  abstract  = {a flaky test is a test that may fail or pass for the same code under testing (cut). flaky tests could be harmful to developers because the non-deterministic test outcome is not reliable and developers cannot easily debug the code. a prior study characterized the root causes and fixing strategies of flaky tests by analyzing commits of 51 apache open source projects, without analyzing any android app. due to the popular usage of android devices and the multitude of interactions of android apps with third-party software libraries, hardware, network, and users, we were curious to find if the android apps manifested unique flakiness patterns and called for any special resolution for flaky tests as compared to the existing literature. for this paper, we conducted an empirical study to characterize the flaky tests in android apps. by classifying the root causes and fixing strategies of flakiness, we aimed to investigate how our proposed characterization for flakiness in android apps varies from prior findings, and whether there are domain-specific flakiness patterns. after mining github, we found 29 android projects containing 77 commits that were relevant to flakiness. we identified five root causes of android apps' flakiness. we revealed three novel causes - dependency, program logic, and ui. five types of resolution strategies were observed to address the flaky behavior. many of the examined commits show developers' attempt to fix flakiness by changing software implementation in various ways. however, there are still 13% commits that simply skipped or removed the flaky tests. our observations provide useful insights for future research on flaky tests of android apps.},

  abstract  = {summary form only given. this research initiative seeks to develop a framework for better understanding the role of antenna design in inference-based tasks about interactions among device owners. in the envisioned setting, a collection of monitoring radios gather information about the geographical locations of devices over time using packet sniffing. the monitoring stations are passive, listening to ongoing wi-fi communications in promiscuous mode. these radios only record and disseminate meta data, thereby preserving the anonymity of the owners. more specifically, the monitoring system stores time-stamped, media access control (mac) addresses as unique identifiers. the collected information, which is stored in a centralized database, is then analyzed to assess basic graphical properties, such as friendship or other forms of social connectivity. the underlying assumption in this work is that, under normal conditions in a public place, spatiotemporal interaction is a strong indicator of social connectivity. in other words, devices that often found themselves in close proximity are likely to be owned by people who know one another. the objective of this effort is to examine the impact of the antenna when conducting this network inference, and study the tradeoffs associated with the size of the antenna, its physically-achievable radiation patterns, and the quality of the information it can provide in this scenario. in particular, an antenna with a broad pattern will likely be able to listen to a much larger number of devices, but the spatial resolution of these devices will be poor. on the other hand, an antenna with a narrow directed beam is less likely to capture pertinent activity, yet it offers much better spatial resolution. this natural tradeoff between the amount of data collected and the quality of the gathered information is explored through numerical simulations and testbed implementation. this leads to guidelines on the design of effective antennas for the purpose of inference. these findings extend to adaptive implementations with pattern-dynamic antennas. this preliminary study offers supporting evidence to the claim that the careful design of antenna patterns can improve the performance of monitoring systems significantly, leading to better estimates of pairwise interactions. overall performance is subject to device density and the a priori probability of interactions among pairs of randomly selected owners. to carry our analysis, we postulate that active devices are confined to lie in a two-dimensional square. the motion of each device is modeled as an independent random walk, reflected at the boundaries. however, the walk pauses for a random amount of time when two related devices find themselves in close proximity. the testbed implementation is based on androidtm smartphones and radio monitoring devices with custom antennas.},

  abstract  = {current operating system designs require applications (apps) to implicitly place trust in a large amount of code. taking android as an example, apps must trust both the kernel as well as privileged userspace services that consist of hundreds of thousands of lines of code. malware apps, on the other hand, aim to exploit any vulnerabilities in the above large trusted base to escalate their privileges. once malware escalates its privileges, additional attacks become feasible, such as stealing credentials by scanning memory pages or intercepting user interactions of sensitive apps, e.g., those used for banking or health management. this paper introduces a novel mechanism, called anception, that strategically deprivileges a significant portion of the kernel and system services, moving them to an untrusted container, thereby significantly reducing the attack surface for privilege escalation available to malware. anception supports unmodified apps, running on a modified android kernel. it achieves performance close to native android on several popular macro benchmarks and provides security against many types of known android root exploits.},

  abstract  = {mobile video streaming has gained growing popularity with the rapid adoption of mobile devices (e.g., smart-phones, tablets, pads). in the market of mobile devices, a large portion were installed with google's android as the default operating system. a clear understanding of the android media framework is of great importance for the performance optimization of mobile video streaming. in this paper, we focus our attention on demystifying the magic of cache thresholds in the android media framework. as the key control parameters, cache thresholds play an important role in regulating the downloading behavior of a mobile device, which directly affects the cost and quality of mobile streaming. we built a dedicated testbed and conducted a measurement study to measure the cost and quality of mobile video streaming when varying cache thresholds. our measurements pointed out that, the sunk cost incurred by user viewing abortion will grow with the increase of either high or low threshold. more battery energy can be saved if lowering the low threshold. in addition, the freezing phenomenon can be mitigated significantly by increasing the low threshold. it is also interesting to observe that there exists a clear cost-quality tradeoff when varying cache thresholds. it implies that the current static cache management scheme is unsuitable to achieve the best cost-quality tradeoff. we finally discussed a few implications of our results on cache optimization of mobile video streaming.},

  abstract  = {mobile applications have become a popular software development domain in recent years due in part to a large user base, capable hardware, and accessible platforms. however, mobile developers also face unique challenges, including pressure for frequent releases to keep pace with rapid platform evolution, hardware iteration, and user feedback. due to this rapid pace of evolution, developers need automated support for documenting the changes made to their apps in order to aid in program comprehension. one of the more challenging types of changes to document in mobile apps are those made to the graphical user interface (gui) due to its abstract, pixel-based representation. in this paper, we present a fully automated approach, called gcat, for detecting and summarizing gui changes during the evolution of mobile apps. gcat leverages computer vision techniques and natural language generation to accurately and concisely summarize changes made to the gui of a mobile app between successive commits or releases. we evaluate the performance of our approach in terms of its precision and recall in detecting gui changes compared to developer specified changes, and investigate the utility of the generated change reports in a controlled user study. our results indicate that gcat is capable of accurately detecting and classifying gui changes - outperforming developers - while providing useful documentation.},

  abstract  = {one of the hottest topics in the semiconductor industry today is a 3d packaging using through silicon via (tsv) technology. driven by the need for improved electrical performance or the reduction of timing delays, methods to use short vertical interconnects have been developed to replace the long interconnects found in 2d packaging. 3d tsv interposer is an efficient and practical approach to solving die integration challenges. many microsystem devices that will have to move to wafer-level packages will also facilitate further integration using silicon tsv interposers. this paper will address tsv interposer development for mobile applications to replace normal organic laminate substrate. major driver of this work is for pop thickness reduction since current organic pop is one of the thickest components in cellular phone engine. super thin pop test vehicle was designed in order to prove the viability of this technology. this test vehicle was a 12×12mm package with 0.4mm ball pitch on the bottom and 0.4mm pitch between the top and bottom pop package. test vehicle has 0.1mm thick tsv substrate and bare-die flip-chip, achieving 0.7mm total stackup height vs. equivalent organic pop of ~1.5mm. this paper will highlight the tsv interposer test vehicle design, fabrication, assembly process development, warpage behavior study with simulation and experiments, component level reliability test results of the super thin pop test vehicle and future steps.},

  abstract = {multimedia computation has clearly become a primary and demanding application segment for new architectures targeted at portable devices. the main challenge for such architectures is to keep pace with the computational requirements of ever evolving media standards and applications while satisfying the power and energy consumption required to leverage smaller form-factors and longer battery lifetimes. one technique aimed at reducing both the energy consumption and the execution time of an application is reuse. this technique memorizes the outcome of an instruction or set of instructions so that we can reuse it the next time we perform the same operation with the same inputs. in this paper, we analyze a region reuse schema specially focused on multimedia applications. while the technique appears to be, in theory, a promising vehicle to improve both timing and energy for low-end media applications, we will show that the extra hardware cost required becomes a severe shortcoming as we find the undesirable situation where we have to consume more energy in order to reduce the execution time (hence becoming a poor power-oriented solution). to mitigate the overhead of the reuse hardware, we advocate for exploiting a third variable in the power-time trade-off and we evaluate tolerant region reuse, a technique that relies in the tolerance in the output precision of media algorithms to improve reuse. with this technique, we afford to use less consuming hardware structures that drives benefits in both energy and timing. as a trade-off, tolerant region reuse introduces non-noticeable errors in the output data. the main drawback of tolerant region reuse is the strong reliance on application profiling, the need for careful tuning from the application developer, and the inability of the technique to adapt to the variability of the media contents being used as inputs. to address that inflexibility, we introduce dynamic tolerant region reuse. this novel technique overcomes the drawbacks of tolerant region reuse by allowing the hardware to study the precision quality of the region reuse output. our mechanism allows the programmer to grant a minimum threshold on signal-to-noise ratio (snr) while letting the technique adapt to the characteristics of the specific application and workload to minimize time and energy consumption. this leads to greater energy-delay savings while keeps output error below noticeable levels, avoiding at the same time the need of profiling. we studied our mechanism applied to a set of three different processors, from low to high end. as we will show our technique leads to consistent performance improvements in all of our benchmark programs while reducing energy consumption. we can report savings up to 30 percent in the energy*delay factor for all three processors.},

  abstract  = {in recent years, sensitive data leaks of android system attracted significant attention. the traditional tools for detecting leaks usually focus on the precision and recall with few of them addressing the importance of the efficiency. the high costs of these tools often make them fail in analyzing apps in large scale and thus block them from wide usage in practice. in this paper, we propose fastdroid, an efficient and precise tool for detecting sensitive data leaks in android apps. first, a flow-insensitive taint analysis is conducted to construct the taint value graph (tvg) which is defined to describe the process of taint propagation. then, potential taint flows (ptfs) are extracted from tvg. finally, the ptfs are checked on the control flow graph (cfg) to acquire the real taint flows. fastdroid is evaluated on three test suites. the results show that fastdroid maintains a high precision and recall; meanwhile it improves the efficiency significantly.},

  abstract  = {test case prioritization techniques schedule the test cases in an order based on some specific criteria so that the tests with better fault detection capability are executed at an early position in the regression test suite. many existing test case prioritization approaches are code-based, in which the testing of each software version is considered as an independent process. actually, the test results of the preceding software versions may be useful for scheduling the test cases of the later software versions. some researchers have proposed history-based approaches to address this issue, but they assumed that the immediately preceding test result provides the same reference value for prioritizing the test cases of the successive software version across the entire lifetime of the software development process. thus, this paper describes ongoing research that studies whether the reference value of the immediately preceding test results is version-aware and proposes a test case prioritization approach based on our observations. the experimental results indicate that, in comparison to existing approaches, the presented one can schedule test cases more effectively.},

  abstract  = {today, there are several trends that are making the reliability analysis of complex integrated circuits an important challenge in industry. as transistor geometries shrink, the number of physical failure mechanisms is increasing while at the same time the number of transistors per chip is still growing. the rollout of new services is pushing compute demands both in handheld devices and in the data center which is driving up complexity and the level of integration. people are becoming critically dependent on mobile services and expect high availability. looking forward to the deployment of the internet of things (iot) where processors and routers will be embedded in billions of end-points, we are only going to see an increased demand for reliable computing. in this session, we bring together three different industrial perspectives on reliability. the first looks at the end-points, the second looks at the servers and the last looks at the economic drivers for reliability and the demand for new eda tools for reliability analysis. in the first talk, rob aitken from arm will discuss the reliability challenges in mobile applications. as mobile systems continue to increase in size and complexity, and user requirements are also becoming more stringent, it is important for designers of mobile systems to be aware of reliability issues, and to adapt their methodologies accordingly. this talk discusses the issues involved, from latent defects, through soft errors, aging and wearout, and shows how to consider these as part of the design process, how to quantify their effects, and how to mitigate them through design changes. in the second presentation, burcin aktan from intel is going to discuss the evolution of the reliability features that are found in server applications. with so many processing units packed in data centers the reliability requirements on an individual device is growing, especially with integrated memory controllers and very high bandwidth data pathways. what was an “add-on” to a device function, 10–15 years ago, now needs to be considered carefully with stringent budgets distributed to each functional block that contribute to overall error rates. this talk will focus on the evolution of reliability features in a number of server products leading into the current state and look at how today's designers are dealing with the challenges of gathering requirements, translating these to design implementation and delivering quality features to customers. finally we will close with remarks on future directions and possible research areas. in the final presentation, olivier lauzeral from iroc technologies will discuss the importance of methodologies for the reliability analysis of complex socs. there is an inherent cost to adding reliability features in a complex ic and designers need to be able to make informed decisions about how much hardware to allocate for mitigation (redundancy, error correction, repair). a prerequisite to make such choices is clearly defined targets and this requires an economic framework where the cost of failures is understood. once the reliability targets for a system and individual devices are established, there is a need for eda tools which allow designers to compute the failure rate and failure modes within the device. this analysis must include all failure mechanisms (radiation effects, lifetime effects, manufacturing detects) and take into account the relevant de-ratings between faults and observed errors. this new eda infra-structure is key for designers to make effective trade-offs in order to arrive at a cost effective design.},

  abstract = {with the rapid spread of mobile devices, many traditional online social network services, like academic applications, start to develop mobile apps and improve their service quality through mobile sensing. a rich friendship among users can provide support for such applications, e.g., help to delegate sensing tasks in mobile crowd sensing. therefore, studying friend recommendation that offers users' suggestions on who to connect to, so as to enrich the user's friendship, is necessary to mobile social networks (msns). most existing strategies utilize user's relationship, or similarity, to make the recommendation, which overlooks the existence of multi-type connections among users, e.g., common paper based and common topic based connections among authors in academic networks. to overcome such limitation, we characterize each type of connections by a corresponding network layer and then propose a novel algorithm for joint recommendations in multilayer msns. particularly, two types of results are presented in the paper. (i) our proposed algorithm, named as cross-layer 2-hop path (c2p) algorithm, implements the joint recommendation by suggesting a user establish connections to his cross-layer two-hop neighbors, i.e., those who link to the user by two-hop paths with the two hops belonging to two different layers, respectively. in doing so, each produced recommendation item is a combination of user relationships in both two layers and therefore can better meet user demands. (ii) by analytical derivations, along with further empirical validation on real datasets, we give the performance evaluation on our proposed algorithm. firstly, we prove that the algorithm is efficiently implementable with a constant complexity of each recommendation in most cases. then, we evaluate its recommendation performance by two metrics, i.e., accuracy and diversity, where the former metric measures recommendation accuracy and the latter one measures an algorithm's capability to provide diverse recommendation items. our results show that c2p algorithm is optimal in terms of accuracy and for diversity, its performance is no less than the algorithm that is applied in single layers. and finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated on both synthetic and large-scale real datasets, where it outperforms the baseline algorithms with an up to 32% accuracy gain and obtains an approximately 0:5 ratio of the algorithm's diversity to the theoretical upperbound.},

  abstract  = {recently, a new class of mobile applications has appeared that takes into account the behavior of physical phenomenon. prominent examples of such applications include augmented reality applications visualizing physical processes on a mobile device or mobile cyber-physical systems like autonomous vehicles or robots. typically, these applications need to solve partial differential equations (pde) to simulate the behavior of a physical system. there are two basic strategies to numerically solve these pdes: (1) offload all computations to a remote server, (2) solve the pde on the resource-constrained mobile device. however, both strategies have severe drawbacks. offloading will fail if the mobile device is disconnected, and resource constraints require to reduce the quality of the solution. therefore, we propose a new approach for mobile simulations using a hybrid strategy that is robust to communication failures and can still benefit from powerful server resources. the basic idea of this approach is to dynamically decide on the placement of the pde solver based on a prediction of the wireless link availability using markov chains. our tests based on measurement in real cellular networks and real mobile devices show that this approach is able to keep deadline constraints in more than 61 % of the cases compared to a pure offloading approach, while saving up to 74 % of energy compared to a simplified approach.},

  abstract = {this paper presents a novel organic embedded trace damascene redistribution layer (rdl) process for panel-scale 2.5-d interposers and high-density fan-out package (hdfo) substrates. a minimum feature size of 1.5-μm line and space using ultrathin polymer dielectrics on glass, silicon, and as well as on organic laminate was demonstrated. this is the first demonstration of a complete set of materials and processes that can be applied to large glass or organic panels, to bridge the interconnect gap between current semi-additive process (sap) rdl and wafer back-end-of-line (beol) rdl. the ultra-fine pitch multilayer rdl structures demonstrated in this paper achieve an optimum balance of high io density, high electrical performance, and low process costs. io density in terms of ios per mm per layer, as defined by intel, refers to the number of traces routed per millimeter of die edge on one rdl layer of an interposer or package substrate. the current sap technology can achieve an io density of about 40 ios/mm/layer on 510 mm × 510 mm organic laminate panels. the challenges of fabricating copper metal traces below 5 μm width and 5 μm space using conventional sap are discussed. on the other hand, wafer-based beol damascene rdl technology can scale to io densities of greater than 200 ios/mm/layer, but at relatively higher costs on 300-mm-diameter round wafers. an additional challenge for silicon interposers is low die-to-die interconnect data rate of single copper trace due to the high resistance of beol rdl structure. a combination of larger cross-sectional area with high aspect ratio (ar) is preferred for low-resistance, high-bandwidth escape routing traces. in this paper, the materials and process flow of embedded trace damascene rdl technology featuring trenches of 1.5 μm width and 1.5 μm space with ar of 2-4 will be described. a new 5-μm-thick dry film photosensitive polymer dielectric if4605 was used for the trench layer as well as the via layer. a large panel-scalable surface planar dfs8910 tool was used to achieve a highly planar metal-polymer rdl surface, at potentially lower costs than chemical-mechanical polishing that has been used in prior work. the processes discussed in this paper will enable routing of fine copper traces on panel-based interposers and hdfos at higher throughput and potentially lower costs than beol processes. a two-metal layer, 20-μm io pitch silicon-like rdl test vehicle was fabricated with 2.5-μm-wide and 2.5-μm-space embedded traces and integrated with 2-μm-diameter microvias using if4605 on glass. there was no pad in the integration. this pad-less structure can be used for achieving theoretically maximum interconnect density. the process flow emulates the salient features of damascene processes used for beol rdl on semiconductor wafers, but simplifies them using dry film polymer materials and panel processes. hence, it is referred to as organic embedded trace damascene or simplified as an organic damascene process (odp) in this paper. the novel odp interconnect addresses the current limitations of both sap and beol processes. the key highlights of this new odp technology are: 1) io densities of 200 io/mm/layer or more; 2) via-to-via pitch of 20 μm or less; 3) high ar of routing traces in the range of 2-4; 4) precise rdl linewidth control; 5) double-sided process with glass core; and 6) reduced number of process steps and panel-scalability leading to lower fabrication costs.},

  abstract  = {widely used commercial android applications (apps) turn to be of complex guis and hundreds of activities. testing this kind of apps is challenging. existing automated testing tools cannot complete the testing of these complex apps in a short time. however, scaling these tools for parallelism to accelerate the testing is not straightforward. in this paper, we borrow the basic concepts from parallel computing, and introduce the parallel testing platform paraaim. paraaim partitions an app testing job into a set of tasks at the activity granularity. starting from a specific entrance activity, paraaim explores the ui-states of the app and each newly discovered activity spawns a new task. paraaim dispatches the new task to an idle device and sets it up to the entrance by replaying an event sequence. in this manner, the independent parts of the app are explored simultaneously. we focus on the efficiency of this parallel gui exploration schema. paraaim assigns the tasks that have more possibility to find new activities with high priority for better performance. event sequence minimization is also studied to reduce the time cost of replay, and we design widget fuzzy match technique to handle the state inconsistency issue. we evaluated paraaim with 20 popular commercial apps on different settings of android device cluster. the results show that paraaim scales well and evidently increases the average speed of exploration to nearly 2 times with two devices, and 3 times with four devices, than a single device.},

  abstract  = {the increasing activity in the intelligent transportation systems (its) area faces a strong limitation: the slow pace at which the automotive industry is making cars "smarter". on the contrary, the smartphone industry is advancing quickly. existing smartphones are endowed with multiple wireless interfaces and high computational power, being able to perform a wide variety of tasks. by combining smartphones with existing vehicles through an appropriate interface we are able to move closer to the smart vehicle paradigm, offering the user new functionalities and services when driving. in this paper we propose an android- based application that monitors the vehicle through an on board diagnostics (obd-ii) interface, being able to detect accidents. our proposed application estimates the g force experienced by the passengers in case of a frontal collision, which is used together with airbag triggers to detect accidents. the application reacts to positive detection by sending details about the accident through either e-mail or sms to pre-defined destinations, immediately followed by an automatic phone call to the emergency services. experimental results using a real vehicle show that the applica- tion is able to react to accident events in less than 3 seconds, a very low time, validating the feasibility of smartphone based solutions for improving safety on the road.},

  abstract  = {cyber foraging is a technique in which devices (like mobile phones) that have lesser computing resources make use of those at other resource-rich devices. offloading computation to a nearby device (a cloudlet) rather than some remote server, has proved to be beneficial for several resource-intensive mobile applications (apps) like online-gaming, video streaming and face recognition. while techniques to offload applications such that the load on the cloudlets is balanced have been proposed, we believe that one rule does not fit all types of applications. in this paper, we propose raincloud, a cloudlet selection heuristic with dynamic vm provisioning for effective cyber foraging. raincloud ranks cloudlets based on their available system#x002f;network resources (capabilities), specifically depending on the resources required by the application. it also looks for a relatively stable cloudlet so that the app may run to completion before the cloudlet moves out of range of the mobile device. we tested this heuristic on a small testbed and verified that it improves application response time and qos (in terms of jitter). we also noted that raincloud reduces the startup time, which is the time taken for the transmission and synthesis of the vm required to run the app on the cloudlet.},

  abstract  = {power management on current mobile devices relies on os modules known as dvfs governors. however, existing governors determine system configuration only based on low-level information such as cpu load without any input about application-level behaviors. in particular, there exists no communication from mobile apps to energy managers. we find that information about app usage scenarios (e.g., gaming, video chatting) can usually help energy manager perform a better job and achieve more energy savings. although app-level energy optimizations have been proposed, they generally focus on single usage scenarios and do not address optimization across multiple scenarios. in this paper, we propose sceneman, an energy optimization framework for mobile apps based on usage scenario notification. sceneman has three components: an api, a scenario notifier, and an energy manager. the key idea is to make energy managers aware of app-level scenarios. at runtime, apps notify the energy manager about their usage scenarios with provided apis used by developers. the energy manager then takes appropriate actions to minimize energy consumption of the running scenario while meeting performance requirements. energy optimization across scenarios can thus be easily achieved. the framework requires little extra programming effort and can help apps achieve better energy efficiency in a transparent way. we implement our system on a nexus 6 smartphone and test it with 13 real-world apps under 2 usage scenarios, namely, gaming and video chatting. we achieve up to 33.2% energy savings with a worst-case performance loss of 5.1%.},

  abstract  = {intents are android's intra and inter-application communication mechanism. they specify an action to perform, with extra data, and are sent to a receiver component or broadcast to many components. components, in the same or in a distinct app, receive the intent if they are available to perform the desired action. hence, a sound static analyzer must be aware of information flows through intents. that can be achieved by considering intents as both source (when reading) and sink (when writing) of confidential data. but this is overly conservative if the intent stays inside the same app or if the set of apps installed on the device is known in advance. in such cases, a sound approximation of the flow of intents leads to a more precise analysis. this work describes sdli, a novel static analyzer that, for each app, creates an xml summary file reporting a description of the tainted information in outwards intents and of the intents the app is available to serve. sdli discovers confidential information leaks when two apps communicate, by matching their xml summaries, looking for tainted outwards intents of the first app that can be inwards intents of the second app. the tool is implemented inside julia, an industrial static analyzer. on the droidbench testcases, its shows a precision higher than 75%. on some popular apps from the google play marketplace, it spots inter-apps leaks of confidential data, hence showing its practical effectiveness.},

  abstract  = {testing a new android application is hard, since the android platform has a lot of portability and compatibility issues. these issues are caused by its fragmentation and diversified operating-system versions, as well as varied hardware platforms, which can hardly be addressed. due to this fact, crowdsourcing emerged as an ideal way to perform the android testing, as workers possess devices that could cover a large amount of both the operation-system versions and the hardware platforms. additionally, the diversified network settings of crowdsourced workers contribute to this task. however, the manual reporting process can be cumbersome and still need some professional background, which dampens the enthusiasm of the workers. in this paper, we propose a framework to summarize the crowdsourced android testing, which endeavours to ease the workload of workers during the process of crowdsourcing.},

  abstract  = {app responsiveness is the most intuitive interpretation of app performance from user's perspective. traditional performance profilers only focus on one kind of program activities (e.g., cpu profiling), while the cause for slow responsiveness is diverse or even due to the joint effect of multiple kinds. also, various test configurations, such as device hardware and wireless connectivity can have dramatic impact on particular program activities and indirectly affect app responsiveness. conventional mobile testing lacks mechanisms to reveal configuration-sensitive bugs. in this paper, we propose appspin, a tool to automatically diagnose app responsiveness bugs and systematically explore configuration-sensitive bugs. appspin instruments the app to collect program events and ui responsiveness. the instrumented app is exercised with automated monkey testers and appspin correlates excessive and lengthy program events with bad responsiveness detected at runtime. the diagnosis process also synthesizes the major resource bottleneck for the app. after one test run, appspin automatically alters the test configuration to with most bottlenecked resource to further explore responsiveness bugs happened only with particular test configurations. our preliminary experiments with 30 real-world apps show that appspin can detect 123 responsiveness bugs and successfully diagnose the cause for 87% cases, within an average of 15-minute test time. also with altered test configurations, appspin uncovers a notable number of new bugs within four extra test runs.},

  abstract  = {who set an ambitious vision of malaria control which includes reducing malaria case incidence by 90% by 2030. many tools and approaches have been considered to enable the progress toward malaria vision. the use of portable smartphones and machine learning (ml) software is a promising one among them. recently, many ml models have been proposed for malaria detection. from the interview with health workers in the field, we realized ml model should be continuously improved to provide higher accuracy and/or more capability to cover practical issues found in a real setting such as malaria mosquitoes with drug resistance. in this paper, we propose the mobile application for malaria detection which upgrades ml model on its own without depending on internet connection. unavailability of internet connection is commonly observed in malaria epidemic countries. we also learned that ml model should be not only accurate but also resource-efficient. this motivated us to set up performance metrics for ml model. based on the metrics, we chose the optimal ml model of resnet-50. while most of the prior art ml models were optimized in terms of accuracy only, the optimal model of our choice satisfies both accuracy and resource efficiency. with adopting the model, we architect self-upgrading malaria-detection application and it is validated using atam (architecture tradeoff analysis method) to ensure the application works in the resource-constrained setting as desired. lastly, we develop the prototype application and show it diagnoses malaria parasites as expected. to collect more blood samples and feedback from prospect users, we plan to do testing at local clinics in india and myanmar.},

  abstract  = {pop structures have been used widely in digital consumer electronics products such as digital still cameras and mobile phones. however, the final stack height from the top to the bottom package for these structures is higher than that of the current stacked die packages. to reduce the height of the package, a flip chip technology is used. since the logic chips of mobile applications use a pad pitch of less than 80 mum or less, an ultra-fine-pitch flip chip interconnection technique is required. c4 flip chip technology is widely used in area array flip chip packages, but it is not suitable in the ultrafine-pitch flip chips because the c4 solder bumps melt and collapse on the wide opening cu pads. although the industry uses ultrafine-pitch interconnections between au stud bumps on a chip and sn/ag pre-solder on a carrier, this flip chip technique has two major problems. one is that the need for bumps on both die and carrier drives up material costs. the other is that the long bonding process time required in the individual flip chip bonding process with associated heating and cooling steps demands large investments in equipment. to address these problems, we developed the mount and reflow with no-clean flux processes, and new interconnection techniques were developed with cu pillars and sn/ag solder bumps on al pads for wirebonding, were developed. it is very easy to control the gap between die and substrate by adjusting the cu pillar height. since it is unnecessary to control the collapse of the solder bumps, we call this the c2 process for direct chip connection (c2). the c2 bumps are connected to cu substrate pads, which are a surface treated with osp (organic solder preservative), with reflow and no-clean processes. this technology creates the smt/flip chip hybrid assembly for sop (system on package) use. we have produced 50 mum-pitch c2 interconnections and tested their reliability. the interconnection resistance increase caused by the reliability testing is quite small. it is clear that c2 flip chip technology provides robust solder connections at low cost. also the c2 structure with a low-k device was evaluated and no failures were observed at 1,500 cycles in the thermal cycle test. this indicates that low-k c2 structures seem robust. for finer pitch flip chip interconnections, a wafer-level underfill process is needed to overcome the limitations of the standard capillary underfill process for ultra-narrow spaces. to date, a wafer- level underfill process exists for the c2 process with an 80-mum pitch. in addition to fine pitch interconnections, a die thickness of 70 mum is required to reduce the final stack height. such thin die cannot be processed by the c2 process because such dies slip too easily during the reflow process. to resolve this issue, a post-encapsulation grinding (peg) method was developed. in this method the die is ground to less than 70 mum after joining and underfilling. this report presents the peg method and reliability test results for die thicknesses 20 mum, 70 mum and 150 mum.},

  abstract  = {monkey, which is integrated with the android system, becomes the most widely used test input generation tool, owing to the simplicity, effectiveness and good compatibility. however, monkey is based on coordinates of screen and oblivious to the widgets and the gui states, which results in a great many ineffective events that have no contribution to the test. to address the major drawbacks, this paper parses the events of 200 test sequences generated by monkey into human-readable scripts and manually investigate the effects of these events. we find three types of patterns on the ineffective events, including no-ops, single and combination of effect-free ones, and summarize them into ten rules for sequence reduction. then, we implement a tool chard to match these patterns in real-world traces and prune the redundant events. the evaluation on 923 traces from various apps covering 16 categories shows that chard can process 1,000 events in a few seconds and identifies 41.3% events as ineffective ones. meanwhile, the reduced sequence keeps the same functionality with the original one that can trigger the same behaviors. our work can be applied to lessen the diagnose effort for record-and-replay, and as a preprocessing step for other works on analyzing sequences. for instance, chard can remove 72.6% ineffective events and saves 67.6% time of delta debugging in our experiments.},

  abstract = {the android ecosystem today is a growing universe of a few billion devices, hundreds of millions of users and millions of applications targeting a wide range of activities where sensitive information is collected and processed. security of communication and privacy of data are thus of utmost importance in application development. yet, regularly, there are reports of successful attacks targeting android users. while some of those attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the android operating system, others directly concern application-level code written by a large pool of developers with varying experience. recently, a number of studies have investigated this phenomenon, focusing, however, only on a specific vulnerability type appearing in apps, and based on only a snapshot of the situation at a given time. thus, the community is still lacking comprehensive studies exploring how vulnerabilities have evolved over time, and how they evolve in a single app across developer updates. our work fills this gap by leveraging a data stream of 5 million app packages to reconstruct versioned lineages of android apps, and finally, obtained 28 564 app lineages (i.e., successive releases of the same android apps) with more than ten app versions each, corresponding to a total of 465 037 apks. based on these app lineages, we apply state-of-the-art vulnerability-finding tools and investigate systematically the reports produced by each tool. in particular, we study which types of vulnerabilities are found, how they are introduced in the app code, where they are located, and whether they foreshadow malware. we provide insights based on the quantitative data as reported by the tools, but we further discuss the potential false positives. our findings and study artifacts constitute a tangible knowledge to the community. it could be leveraged by developers to focus verification tasks, and by researchers to drive vulnerability discovery and repair research efforts.},

  abstract = {because the characteristics of wireless propagation channels (especially indoor channels) are too diverse and complex, the distance estimation strategy of range-based positioning techniques should adaptively change depending on the environment. in this paper, we study unsupervised learning techniques that efficiently do this without human intervention. as users simply move around an area of interest with mobile devices, the proposed method autonomously learns the characteristics of the surrounding environments and changes the ranging strategy accordingly. to this end, we use either model-based or neural network (nn)-based ranging modules for estimating the distance from neighboring anchor nodes, calculate the position of the devices using trilateration techniques, and define cost functions that indirectly evaluate the accuracy of the ranging module based on the trilateration results. moreover, by assigning a unique trainable variable to each device, the proposed method is also able to compensate for different characteristics between devices without ground truth data. the performance of the proposed method is verified with a real-time location tracking application using received signal strength (rss) measurements from conventional wi-fi access points (aps) or round trip time (rtt) measurements from aps that support the fine timing measurement (ftm) protocol. in cases where a model-based ranging module is used, the proposed method closely achieves the benchmark performance, which perfectly optimizes all the trainable variables on the test data. if nns are adopted in the ranging module, the proposed method even outperforms the benchmark and achieves an average positioning accuracy of up to 2.397 m using rss measurements, and up to 1.547 m using rtt measurements under the 40 mhz bandwidth configuration.},

  abstract  = {it is all too common for products, such as consumer appliances, information systems, mobile apps, and websites, to cause trouble and frustration. for example, products are often difficult or dull to use, make tasks less flexible or more tedious, shift attention away from important or gratifying activities, and simply fail to deliver expected benefits or experiences. by identifying such trouble and frustration in the lab prior to widespread use, usability tests have proven a valuable method for informing redesign efforts. a usability test consists of having test users exercise a product and think aloud about their experience using it, while an evaluator observes the users and listens in on their thoughts. on this basis, the evaluator identifies usability problems and assesses the user experience. this book describes how to conduct usability tests. after providing context about concepts and testing, the main chapters of the book cover the steps involved in preparing for a usability test, executing the test sessions, and analyzing the test data. throughout the chapters, concrete guidance is balanced against more complex issues with an impact on the robustness, validity, completeness, impact, and cost of a usability test. the book concludes with an outlook to variations of usability testing and alternatives to it.},

  abstract        = {biofeedback from physical rehabilitation exercises has proved to lead to faster recovery, better outcomes, and increased patient motivation. in addition, it allows the physical rehabilitation processes carried out at the clinic to be complemented with exercises performed at home. however, currently existing approaches rely mostly on audio and visual reinforcement cues, usually presented to the user on a computer screen or a mobile phone interface. some users, such as elderly people, can experience difficulties to use and understand these interfaces, leading to non-compliance with the rehabilitation exercises. to overcome this barrier, latest biosignal technologies can be used to enhance the efficacy of the biofeedback, decreasing the complexity of the user interface. in this paper we propose and validate a context-aware framework for the use of animatronic biofeedback, as a way of potentially increasing the compliance of elderly users with physical rehabilitation exercises performed at home. in the scope of our work, animatronic biofeedback entails the use of pre-programmed actions on a robot that are triggered in response to certain changes detected in the users biomechanical or electrophysiological signals. we use electromyographic and accelerometer signals, collected in real time, to monitor the performance of the user while executing the exercises, and a mobile robot to provide animatronic reinforcement cues associated with their correct or incorrect execution. a context-aware application running on a smartphone aggregates the sensor data and controls the animatronic feedback. the acceptability of the animatronic biofeedback has been tested on a set of volunteer elderly users, and results suggest that the participants found the animatronic feedback engaging and of added value. © 2015, springer science+business media new york.},

  abstract        = {in this paper, we propose a proximity-based indoor positioning system which is capable of monitoring mobile device user’s indoor locations where the commonly used gps signal is unavailable or weak. the designed system is aimed to be integrated into a context-aware communications system to prevent transmission of irrelevant content to all users but easing delivery of the location-based information. similar to the beacon technology that assigns a code to each targeted position in an indoor location, our system labels the locations with audio watermark codes where user’s mobile device monitors and receives the watermarked audio. the proposed encoder performs code-division multiplexing that allows insertion of several location indexes into the same audio file. watermark embedded through spread spectrum improves robustness to noise and guarantees a satisfactory performance even though the mobile device has a low band microphone. the designed decoder installs synchronization between the mobile device and the watermarked audio emitter in real time, and extracts the embedded watermark code words assigned to specific indoor locations. this invokes the context-aware content delivery module and the delivery is initiated. position displacements of the mobile users are estimated by the time-of-flight technique and the users moving within the coverage range of the emitters are continuously monitored. decoding is achieved in real time that enables the mobile users to reach to content delivered from different emitters within their coverage range. performance tests demonstrate that the developed system enables to estimate the user position within the 7-m distance from the emitter while keeping inaudibility. we reached 2-m spatial resolution in discrimination of different emitters. the proposed framework can be considered as a promising alternative to latest technologies, i.e., wi-fi-based fingerprinting systems or beacons. © 2020, springer-verlag gmbh germany, part of springer nature.},

  abstract        = {background: each year, hospitals lose a considerable amount of time and money due to misplaced mobile assets. in addition the assets which remain in departments that frequently use them depreciate early, while other assets of the same type in different departments are rarely used. a real time locating system can prevent these losses when used with appropriate asset sharing policies. objective: this research quantifies the amount of time a medium size hospital saves by using real time locating system and proposes an asset selection rule to eliminate the asset usage imbalance problem. methods: the asset selection rule proposed is based on multi objective optimization techniques. the effectiveness of this rule on asset to patient time and asset utilization rate variance performance measures were tested using discrete event simulation method. results: results show that the proposed asset selection rule improved the usage balance significantly. sensitivity analysis showed that the proposed rule is robust to changes in demand rates and user preferences. conclusions: real time locating systems enable saving considerable amount of time in hospitals, and they can still be improved by integrating decision support mechanisms. combining tracking technology and asset selection rules helps improve healthcare services. © 2016 - ios press and the authors. all rights reserved.},

  abstract        = {usability is of significant importance for any interactive software. in the mobile domain, applications face more challenges to deliver good experiences to end users due to the characteristics and usage of mobile devices in ubiquitous computing contexts. the situation may be exacerbated for mobile health applications since the target population or domain may impose even stricter usability requirements. heuristic evaluation (he) or guideline review has proven itself to be an effective approach among many usability evaluation methods. organizing heuristic evaluation by usability professionals, however, can be costly and time consuming, particularly for frequent prototype updates generated by fast iterations. manual inspection by human experts also suffers from scalability issues as mobile applications often need to run on a diverse set of hardware platforms. to help find potential usability problems at an early stage and reduce the workload of human usability experts, we propose an inspection framework to conduct automated guideline reviews of mobile health applications. the inspection framework is based on the health information management systems society (himss) usability guidelines for mhealth applications. first, we translate the high level descriptions of usability guidelines into operationalized metrics that can be measured by software. second, we demonstrate the translation is meaningful by providing detailed analysis of suggested metrics and real-world case studies. we hope this framework can be used to enforce a minimum bar for the usability of mobile health applications and further adapted when new products in the field are developed. copyright © 2014 acm.},

  abstract      = {smartphones are playing an increasingly important role in helping people share information and communicate with each other, as evidenced by an increasing number of applications (or apps), including news, search engine, mailbox, and social networking apps. the more heavily people rely on their phones, the more they begin to take the term "user experience" into consideration when buying a smartphone. obviously, the key to providing a good user experience is to minimize the response time of each graphical user interface (gui) operation, such as a touch, slide, or flick. thus, it is crucial for smartphone manufacturers and mobile app developers to measure the response times to enhance the performance of the device or application. in this article, the authors present the smartphone response time measuring platform (smart), a novel and low-cost platform for measuring the response time of a smartphone. smart consists of a normal 30-fps (frame per second) webcam and a mirror. the proposed platform first simultaneously records the changes on a smartphone screen and the gui operation shown in the mirror. it then adopts image processing techniques to analyze the latency of the gui operation. the authors' validation results show that the measurement error of smart is less than 1/30 s, which means that smart is a practical solution for measuring the latency of gui operations. in addition, they adopted smart for the measurements and analysis of six different commercial smartphones to further demonstrate its applicability. © 2019 society for imaging science and technology.},

  abstract        = {the process of knowledge discovery in health databases has steadily been developing. data mining (dm) techniques integrate several knowledge fields for extraction of reliable, understandable, and useful patterns, such as statistics and artificial intelligence (ai). in this sense, this paper proposes the application of a machine learning (ml) technique, named support vector machine (svm), for the recognition of patterns in a pregnancy database. this approach has outperformed other ml methods, representing a valuable tool for smart decision support systems (dsss) and mobile health (m-health) applications. for the performance assessment of the proposed model, this work uses the 10-fold cross-validation method. this mlbased technique obtained encouraging results with an accuracy of 0.821, a true positive (tp) rate of 0.839, a false positive (fp) rate of 0.268, and receiver operating characteristic (roc) area of 0.785. these indicators show that this approach is an excellent pattern recognizer for pregnancy care. this research provides a comprehensive inference mechanism for mobile dsss capable of enhancing the care provided to women who are at a risk of developing pregnancy-related problems. thus, this work can contribute to improve the maternal and fetal health conditions, predicting preterm birth risk early. © 2018 ieee.},

  abstract        = {the telecare medicine information system (tmis) helps the patients to gain the health monitoring facility at home and access medical services over the internet of mobile networks. recently, amin and biswas presented a smart card based user authentication and key agreement security protocol usable for tmis system using the cryptographic one-way hash function and biohashing function, and claimed that their scheme is secure against all possible attacks. though their scheme is efficient due to usage of one-way hash function, we show that their scheme has several security pitfalls and design flaws, such as (1) it fails to protect privileged-insider attack, (2) it fails to protect strong replay attack, (3) it fails to protect strong man-in-the-middle attack, (4) it has design flaw in user registration phase, (5) it has design flaw in login phase, (6) it has design flaw in password change phase, (7) it lacks of supporting biometric update phase, and (8) it has flaws in formal security analysis. in order to withstand these security pitfalls and design flaws, we aim to propose a secure and robust user authenticated key agreement scheme for the hierarchical multi-server environment suitable in tmis using the cryptographic one-way hash function and fuzzy extractor. through the rigorous security analysis including the formal security analysis using the widely-accepted burrows-abadi-needham (ban) logic, the formal security analysis under the random oracle model and the informal security analysis, we show that our scheme is secure against possible known attacks. furthermore, we simulate our scheme using the most-widely accepted and used automated validation of internet security protocols and applications (avispa) tool. the simulation results show that our scheme is also secure. our scheme is more efficient in computation and communication as compared to amin-biswas’s scheme and other related schemes. in addition, our scheme supports extra functionality features as compared to other related schemes. as a result, our scheme is very appropriate for practical applications in tmis. © 2015, springer science+business media new york.},

  abstract        = {the increase of mobile applications and social media are daily generating huge volumes of data. the variety of this data shapes an evolving term known as big data. efficiently handling the big data seems a challenge to meet the rate of data growth. this challenge has played a significant role not only for indexing, but also for correlating events across space and time of big data security analytics. therefore, this paper introduces a bloom filter (bf) which is a space-and-time efficient probabilistic technique. the bf and its variants are summarized in terms of their contributions to the network security domain. besides, these variants are evaluated against the characteristics of big data security analytics. by conducting an experiment with a huge volume of data, the introduced technique along with an unsupervised learning engine is tested. the results showed that the bf can be used to overcome the efficiency lacking in the space-and-time of both indexing and analyzing big data. © 2016 ieee.},

  abstract        = {rapid development has been observed in the deployment of communication technologies and the use of the internet across the globe. information exchange is the main aspect of use of such technologies in everyday life. crimes associated with the misuse of information on the internet are on the increase and are resulting in various losses. saudi arabia is one of the fastest developing countries in the middle east, where the uptake of communication technologies such as the internet and mobile technologies has risen sharply in recent years. these technologies are relatively new to the region when compared to developed countries. therefore, the crimes associated with these technologies may be new to the people in the region. this paper investigates the cyber security awareness of the people in saudi arabia within different contexts. a quantitative online based survey was conducted to gather information related to cyber security awareness in saudi arabia. the study found that, although the participants had a good knowledge of it, their awareness of the threats associated with cybercrime, cyber security practices, and the role of government and organisations in ensuring information safety across the internet, is very limited. an application based model to create cyber security awareness in the region was preferred by the majority. the results indicated that, although cybercrime is on the rise, no specific approach is being followed to increase cyber security awareness in the region except for cert regulations and online information on government websites. additionally, chi-square test results (t(627)=3.85, p=0.013) indicated that internet skills have an effect on cyber security practices from the users' end and there is an association between skill level and the security measures being implemented by organisations in the region. the study found that there is an immediate need to develop a model to create cyber security awareness in the region in order to combat cybercrime. © 2016 infonomics society.},

  abstract        = {the subjective visual vertical (svv) is a common test for evaluating the perception of verticality. altered verticality has been connected with disorders in the otolithic, visual or proprioceptive systems, caused by stroke, parkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis, among others. currently, this test is carried out using a variety of specific, mostly homemade apparatuses that include moving planes, buckets, hemispheric domes or a line projected in a screen. our aim is to develop a flexible, inexpensive, user-friendly and easily extensible system based on virtual reality for the measurement of the svv and several related visual diagnostic tests, and validate it through an experimental evaluation. two different hardware configurations were tested with 50 healthy volunteers in a controlled environment; 28 of them were males and 22 females, with ages ranging from 18 to 49 years, being 23 the average age. the intraclass correlation coefficient (icc) was computed in each device. in addition, a usability survey was conducted. icc = 0.85 in the first configuration (ci = 0.75–0.92), icc = 0.76 in the second configuration (ci = 0.61–0.87), both with 95% of confidence, which means a substantial reliability. moreover, 92.2% of subjects rated the usability of the system as “very good”. our evaluation showed that the proposed system is suitable for the measurement of svv in healthy subjects. the next step is to perform a more elaborated experimentation on patients and compare the results with the measurements obtained from traditional methods. © 2018, springer science+business media, llc, part of springer nature.},

  abstract        = {one of most hopeful applications in next generation information technologies and communication is multimedia mobile computing over ubiquitous network. in order to meet strong demand for mobility, usability, security, reality, and real time responsibility, some strategy is crucial for the design of multimedia mobile processors. in developing cutting edge vlsi processors, parallelism is one of the most important global standard strategics to achieve power conscious high performance. then, one of most important issues for ubiquitous systems is instruction scheduling, because floating point units indispensable for multimedia mobile applications take longer latency than integer units. thus, it is really worthwhile to exploit hardware parallelism free from awkward instruction scheduling. a double scheme for this issue is a waved multifunctional unit to achieve both power conscious high performance and high precision computing. incorporating a multifunctionalized scalar unit in the execution stage, an instruction pipeline is made free from instruction scheduling, because it takes the same latency to execute any function. then, the wave-pipelining recovers the reduction of clock speed to be caused by the scale up of a multifunctional circuit, because the clock speed of a wave-pipeline is determined by the difference between the critical path delay and the minimum path delay of the waved circuit. this article confirms the reasonability of the waved mfu for scheduling free ilp and the usage of the waved mfu in multimedia mobile computing by evaluating clock speed, power dissipation and occupied area. these are studied in detail focusing on wave degree dependency.},

  abstract        = {purpose: the purpose of this paper is to examine (a)symmetric features of task-technology-performance characteristics that are most relevant to fit, satisfaction and continuance intention of using apps in mobile banking transactions. design/methodology/approach: exploratory factor analysis was used with maximum likelihood extraction and varimax rotation on a separate sample of 183 mobile banking apps users prior to the main data collection. the theoretical model was tested applying a factor-based structural equation modelling approach to a sample of 250 experienced mobile banking apps users. findings: the study unveiled that the task and performance characteristics are more relevant compared to technology characteristics when doing transactions via apps. in addition, the findings uncovered that user satisfaction and continuous intention to use apps stem from the degree of fit in online transactions. the findings of moderation analysis highlighted that users in the lower income group are more concerned about the performance characteristics of banking apps, and there are no differences across age and gender groups. surprisingly, technology characteristic has a nonlinear nature and this study shows potential boundary conditions of technology characteristics in degree of fit, user satisfaction and continuance intention to use apps. practical implications: findings from the conditional probabilistic queries reveal that with 83.3 per cent of probability, user satisfaction is high when using apps for banking transactions, if the levels of fit, task, performance and technology characteristics are high. furthermore, with 72 per cent of probability, continuance intention to use apps is high, if the levels of performance and task characteristics are high. originality/value: contributing to task-technology fit theory, this study shows that performance characteristics need to be aligned with task and technology characteristics in order to have better fit when using apps for online banking transactions. © 2019, emerald publishing limited.},

  abstract        = {automated testing techniques can effectively explore mobile applications in order to find faults that manifest as program crashes. a number of different techniques for automatically testing apps have been proposed and empirically compared, but previous studies focused on comparing different tools, rather than techniques. although these studies have shown search-based approaches to be effective, it remains unclear whether superior performance of one tool compared to another is due to fundamental advantages of the underlying search technique, or due to certain engineering choices made during the implementation of the tools. in order to provide a better understanding of app testing as a search problem, we empirically study different search algorithms within the same app testing framework. experiments on a selection of 10 non-trivial apps reveal that the costs of fitness evaluations are inhibitive, and prevent the choice of algorithm from having a major effect. © 2019, ifip international federation for information processing.},

  abstract        = {we propose a model-based test generation methodology to evaluate the impact of the interaction of the wireless network and application configurations on the performance of mobile networked applications. we consider waiting time delay to model wireless network quality. we classify mobile applications into two groups. group i represents applications where end-user experience is mainly affected by waiting time delay during service consumption, while group ii represents applications where end-user experience is affected by waiting time delay before service consumption. test generation is formulated as an inversion problem. however, for group i applications, solving the inversion problem is expensive. therefore, we utilize metamorphic testing to mitigate the cost of test oracles. we formulate metamorphic test generation as maximization of the distance between seed and follow-up test cases. two test coverage criteria are proposed: user experience and user-experience-and-input interaction. network models are developed for a mobile device that has network access through a wifi hot spot and uses either transmission control protocol or user datagram protocol. two mobile applications are used to demonstrate the methodology: multimedia streaming and web browsing. application of the methodology when user actions are taken into consideration is also addressed. the effectiveness of the methodology is evaluated using two metrics: the incurred time cost and redundancy in the generated test suite. the obtained results show the advantage of casting test generation as an inversion problem, compared with random testing. for apps with intensive performance models, combining metamorphic testing with the methodology has tremendously reduced the cost of test oracles. copyright © 2019 john wiley & sons, ltd.},

  abstract        = {"mobile tourism" represents a relatively new trend in the field of tourism and involves the use of mobile devices as electronic tourist guides. while much of the underlying technology is already available, there are still open challenges with respect to design, usability, portability, functionality and implementation aspects. most existing "mobile tourism" solutions either represent of-the-shelf applications with rigidly defined content or involve portable devices with networking capabilities that access tourist content with the requirement of constant airtime, i.e., continuous wireless network coverage. this paper presents the design and implementation issues of a "mobile tourism" research prototype, which brings together the main assets of the two aforementioned approaches. namely, it enables the creation of portable tourist applications with rich content that matches user preferences. the users may download these personalized applications (optimized for their specific device's model) either directly to their mobile device or first to a pc and then to a mobile terminal (through infrared or bluetooth). thereafter, network coverage is not further required as the applications execute in standalone mode and may be updated when the user returns online. the dynamically created tourist applications also incorporate a "push model", wherein new tourist content is forwarded to the mobile terminal with minimal user intervention as soon as it is added or updated by the administrator. our prototype has been developed on the top of java 2 micro edition (j2me) which offers an ideal platform for the development of full-fledged, interactive and portable applications tailored for resource-constrained mobile devices. the paper presents our development experiences with j2me and highlights its main advantages and shortcomings in relation to the implementation of such kind of applications. finally, an empirical evaluation of user experience with the mobile application prototype is presented. © springer-verlag london limited 2007.},

  abstract        = {as the popularity of android smart phones has increased in recent years, so too has the number of malicious applications. due to the potential for data theft that mobile phone users face, the detection of malware on android devices has become an increasingly important issue for the field of cyber security. traditional methods like signature-based routines are unable to protect users from the ever-increasing sophistication and rapid behavior changes in new types of android malware. therefore, a great deal of effort has been made recently to use machine learning models and methods to characterize and generalize the malicious behavior patterns of mobile apps for malware detection. in this paper, we propose a novel and highly reliable classifier for android malware detection based on a factorization machine architecture and the extraction of android app features from manifest files and source code. our results indicate that the numerical feature representation of an app typically results in a long and highly sparse vector and that the interactions among different features are critical to revealing malicious behavior patterns. after performing an extensive performance evaluation, our proposed method achieved a test result of 100.00% precision score on the drebin dataset and 99.22% precision score with only 1.10% false positive rate on the amd dataset. these metrics match the performance of state-of-the-art machine-learning-based android malware detection methods and several commercial antivirus engines with the benefit of training up to 50 times faster. © 2013 ieee.},

  abstract        = {it is critical to address potential performance problems of xml-based soap to design a web service communication framework for mobile devices, as the mobile computing environment is physically constrained to limited computing power and network bandwidth. in this paper, we describe a web service communication framework for mobile computing, which optimizes soap message contents. the performance and efficiency of web service messaging can be significantly improved by removing the redundant or unchanging parts of soap messages. this paper shows that the redundant or static parts of a soap message may be treated as metadata and stored in a shared metadata space, for which we integrate our optimized web service communication framework with an information service. we evaluate our architecture through a benchmark testing of the resulting system. the empirical result shows that we save on average 83% of message size and on average 41% of transit time.},

  abstract        = {energy consumption, execution time, and availability are common terms in discussions on application development for mobile devices. mobile applications executing in a mobile cloud computing (mcc) environment must consider several issues, such as internet connections problems and cpu performance. misconceptions during the design phase can have a significant impact on costs and time-to-market, or even make the application development unfeasible. anticipating the best configuration for each type of application is a challenge that many developers are not prepared to tackle. in this work, we propose models to rapidly estimate execution time, availability, and energy consumption of mobile applications executing in an mcc environment. we defined a methodology to create and validate deterministic and stochastic petri net (dspn) models to evaluate these three critical metrics. the dspns results were compared with results obtained through experiments performed on a testbed environment. we analyzed an image processing application, regarding connections type (wlan, wifi, and 3g), servers type (mcc or cloudlet), and functionalities performance. our numerical analyses indicate, for instance, that the use of a cloudlet significantly improves performance and energy efficiency. besides, the baseline scenario took us one month to implement, while modeling and evaluation the three scenarios required less than one day. in this way, our dspn models represent a powerful tool for mobile developers to plan efficient and cost-effective mobile applications. they allow rapidly assess execution time, availability, and energy consumption metrics to improve the quality of mobile applications. © 2019, springer-verlag gmbh austria, part of springer nature.},

  abstract        = {this paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of vanarsena, an automated fault finder for mobile applications ("apps"). the techniques in vanarsena are driven by a study of 25 million real-world crash reports of windows phone apps reported in 2012. our analysis indicates that a modest number of root causes are responsible for many observed failures, but that they occur in a wide range of places in an app, requiring a wide coverage of possible execution paths. vanarsena adopts a "greybox" testing method, instrumenting the app binary to achieve both coverage and speed. vanarsena runs on cloud servers: the developer uploads the app binary; vanarsena then runs several app "monkeys" in parallel to emulate user, network, and sensor data behavior, returning a detailed report of crashes and failures. we have tested vanarsena with 3000 apps from the windows phone store, finding that 1108 of them had failures; vanarsena uncovered 2969 distinct bugs in existing apps, including 1227 that were not previously reported. because we anticipate vanarsena being used in regular regression tests, testing speed is important. vanarsena uses two techniques to improve speed. first, it uses a "hit testing" method to quickly emulate an app by identifying which user interface controls map to the same execution handlers in the code. second, it generates a processingcompleted event to accurately determine when to start the next interaction. these features are key benefits of vanarsena's greybox philosophy. © 2014 acm.},

  abstract        = {being an easy-to-deploy and cost-effective low power wireless solution, bluetooth low energy (ble) has been widely used by internet-of-things (iot) devices. in a typical iot scenario, an iot device first needs to be connected with its companion mobile app which serves as a gateway for its internet access. to establish a connection, a device first broadcasts advertisement packets with uuids to nearby smartphone apps. leveraging these uuids, a companion app is able to identify the device, pairs and bonds with it, and allows further data communication. however, we show that there is a fundamental flaw in the current design and implementation of the communication protocols between a ble device and its companion mobile app, which allows an attacker to precisely fingerprint a ble device with static uuids from the apps. meanwhile, we also discover that many ble iot devices adopt “just works” pairing, allowing attackers to actively connect with these devices if there is no app-level authentication. even worse, this vulnerability can also be directly uncovered from mobile apps. furthermore, we also identify that there is an alarming number of vulnerable app-level authentication apps, which means the devices connected by these apps can be directly controlled by attackers. to raise the public awareness of ble iot device fingerprinting and also uncover these vulnerable ble iot devices before attackers, we develop an automated mobile app analysis tool blescope and evaluate it with all of the free ble iot apps in google play store. our tool has identified 1,757 vulnerable mobile apps in total. we also performed a field test in a 1.28 square miles region, and identified 5, 822 real ble devices, among them 5, 509 (94.6%) are fingerprintable by attackers, and 431 (7.4%) are vulnerable to unauthorized access. we have made responsible disclosures to the corresponding app developers, and also reported the fingerprinting issues to the bluetooth special interest group. © 2019 association for computing machinery.},

  abstract        = {history subjects are often connected with the traditional and teacher-centered learning which is not a very effective method. the learning and teaching technique of history subject is static, and students easily lost their interest to memorizing the facts. from the preliminary study towards the primary school history teacher, they stated that history subject was very challenging subject to be taught since it was difficult to attract the pupils to imagine and appreciate the malay history era. the study aims to highlight how teaching by using digital game-based learning (dgbl) can be applied as one of the techniques to improve history subject teaching method. this aim was achieved by answering three research objectives, 1)identifying the current practice among the teacher in teaching malay historical subject, 2)investigating the teachers' perceptions toward using dgbl and 3) determining the barriers that influence teachers towards using dgbl in teaching malay historical subject. the study was conducted together with 35 primary school malay historical subject teachers in malaysia. prototype evaluation was conducted using one to one testing with 14 participants. a part of the study requiredthe participants to rank 20 prospective barriers identified as obstacles to digital game-based learning. © beiesp.},

  abstract      = {the rate of progress in human neurosciences is limited by the inability to easily apply a wide range of analysis methods to the plethora of different datasets acquired in labs around the world. in this work, we introduce a framework for creating, testing, versioning and archiving portable applications for analyzing neuroimaging data organized and described in compliance with the brain imaging data structure (bids). the portability of these applications (bids apps) is achieved by using container technologies that encapsulate all binary and other dependencies in one convenient package. bids apps run on all three major operating systems with no need for complex setup and configuration and thanks to the comprehensiveness of the bids standard they require little manual user input. previous containerized data processing solutions were limited to single user environments and not compatible with most multi-tenant high performance computing systems. bids apps overcome this limitation by taking advantage of the singularity container technology. as a proof of concept, this work is accompanied by 22 ready to use bids apps, packaging a diverse set of commonly used neuroimaging algorithms. © 2017 gorgolewski et al.},

  abstract        = {in mobile applications, computational complexity is an issue that limits sophisticated algorithms from being implemented on these devices. this paper provides an initial solution to applying pattern recognition systems on mobile devices by combining existing preprocessing algorithms for recognition. in pattern recognition systems, it is essential to properly apply feature preprocessing tools prior to training classification models in an attempt to reduce computational complexity and improve the overall classification accuracy. the feature preprocessing tools extended for the mobile environment are feature ranking, feature extraction, data preparation and outlier removal. most desktop systems today are capable of processing a majority of the available classification algorithms without concern of processing while the same is not true on mobile platforms. as an application of pattern recognition for mobile devices, the recognition system targets the problem of steganalysis, determining if an image contains hidden information. the measure of performance shows that feature preprocessing increases the overall steganalysis classification accuracy by an average of 22%. the methods in this paper are tested on a workstation and a nokia 6620 (symbian operating system) camera phone with similar results.},

  note          = {cited by 5},
  abstract      = {the increased use of mobile appliances in today's society has resulted in an increase of reliability issues related to drop performance. mobile appliances are dropped multiple times during their lifespan and the product is required to survive common drop accidents. the use of lead-free solder compositions and the decreasing size of microelectronics aggravated the sensitivity of these products towards drop failures. also, the use of miniature ic packages like wafer level chip scale packages (wlcsp) with smaller lead sizes resulted in a decreased amount of material available to absorb the loading caused by a drop. a widely accepted method to assess the drop reliability of microelectronics on board-level is the drop impact test. the drop impact test has been standardized by international councils like jedec and is widely adopted throughout the industry. the intention of the drop test is to assess the overall product reliability towards dropping, focusing on the solder interconnections. these solder interconnections are usually the first link in the chain to fail. clearly the drop impact reliability of a product is also influenced by numerous design factors like material compositions, ball layout and product size as well as manufacturing conditions. solder loading is investigated in this research by using high-speed camera recordings of several drop impact tests with verified finite element models. these simulation models are developed in order to gain an insight on the loading pattern of solder joints based on product specifications, interconnect layout and drop conditions prior to physical prototyping. deflections and frequencies during drop testing are measured using a high-speed camera setup. the high-speed camera experiments are performed on two levels: product level (with different levels of energy and different pulse times) and machine level (rebounds with and without a catcher). parametric (dynamic and quasi static) 3d models are developed to predict the drop impact performance. the experimental results are used to verify and enhance the simulation models, e.g. by tuning the damping parameters. as a result, the verified models can be used to determine the location of the critical solder joint and to obtain estimates of the solder lifetime performance. ©2008 ieee.},

  abstract        = {this paper describes the major research and development activities which have been achieved so far since the launch of the desurbs project (www.desurbs.eu) in 2011. the project focuses on the development of a decision-support system portal (dssp) which integrates information, data and software modules representing city assets, hazards and processing models that simulate exposures to risks and potential compromise to safety and security. the use of the dssp will aid the design of safer and more resilient urban spaces. specifically, it provides security related scenarios with contextual information to support various types of users who specialise in urban spatial design and planning. the dssp is a web enabled system which is also adapted to mobile devices usage. it is supported with geographic maps and visualised aggregated data from a number of heterogeneous sources. a responsive web design which adapts to the resolution of smart mobile devices has also been achieved. that is, low powered mobiles can still provide map oriented data in a responsive fashion, while using multiple platforms (android and ios currently). the first dssp prototype employs the united kingdom crime statistics feed of year 2012 and analyses crime trends in 13 english cities (including greater london) which are distributed into four major-regions. the dssp displays raw crime data via a marker on a map, while they are aggregated under specific crime type threads and visualised as "heat maps". the specific visualisations are aligned to the various administrative regions such as neighbourhoods, catchments and postcodes. it also allows users to explore historical crime trends for a region over time, where crime statistics are contrasted. the scalability of the dssp was also tested under increasingly large datasets and numbers of users, with tested loads on the map server and the main django user application. the difference in speed between the mobile and desktop interfaces for a defined set of tasks using the application shall also be performed and presented in the near future. © ifip international federation for information processing 2013.},

  abstract        = {agriculture remains the backbone of several economies in the world, especially in underdeveloped countries. with the rapid growth of the population and the increasing demand in food, farmers need to maximize the productivity and one possibility is the reduction of losses. weeds are one of the major dangers in farming.indeed, they competevigorously with the crop for nutrients and water. as result, they can cause the loss of 10% to 100% of the total harvest. this work aimed at developing a new model tailored to classify crops and weeds images. using a pubic dataset of 5339 plant images from aarhus university signal processing group in collaboration with university of southern denmark, we proposed a methodology based on transfer learning technique to classify 12 species of crops and weeds. firstly, we converted images to jpeg format in order to accelerate the convergence and data augmentation techniques such as resizing, rotating, flipping, scaling were employed to reduce the chances of overfitting. then, a model trained on imagenet dataset with residual network 101 architecture was used for performing transfer learning. finally, the network’s parameters were adjusted through various techniques involving progressive resizing, cyclical learning rate and focal loss function for improving the performance. our model achieved an overall accuracy of 98,47% during validation and of 96,04% on the test set. we already deployed the model over internet through a web application and our next step will be to integrate this solution within a mobile application and embedded devices.future works concerns with the use of more features and descriptors to accurately distinguish two specificclasses of weeds: black-grass and loose silky-bent, and the possibility to extend our approach to other kinds of plants. © beiesp.},

  abstract        = {mobile cloud computing (mcc) is an emerging technology to facilitate complex application execution on mobile devices. mobile users are motivated to implement various tasks using their mobile devices for great flexibility and portability. however, such advantages are challenged by the limited battery life of mobile devices. this paper presents cuckoo, a scheme of flexible compute-intensive task offloading in mcc for energy saving. cuckoo seeks to balance the key design goals: maximize energy saving (technical feasibility) and minimize the impact on user experience with limited cost for offloading (realistic feasibility). specifically, using a combination of static analysis and dynamic profiling, compute-intensive tasks are fine-grained marked from mobile application codes offline. according to the network transmission technologies supported in mobile devices and the runtime network conditions, adopting “task-bundled” strategy online offloads these tasks to mcc. in the task-hosted stage, we propose a skyline-based online resource scheduling strategy to satisfy the realistic feasibility of mcc. in addition, we adopt resource reservation to reduce the extra energy consumption caused by the task multi-offloading phenomenon. further, we evaluate the performance of cuckoo using real-life data sets on our mcc testbed. our extensive experiments demonstrate that cuckoo is able to balance energy consumption and execution performance. copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd. copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.},

  abstract        = {certain retinal disorders, if not detected in time, can be serious enough to cause blindness in patients. this paper proposes a low-cost and portable smartphone-based decision support system for initial screening of diabetic retinopathy using sophisticated image analysis and machine learning techniques. it requires a smartphone to be attached to a direct hand-held ophthalmoscope. the phone is used to capture fundus images as seen through the direct ophthalmoscope. we deploy pattern recognition on the captured images to develop a classifier that distinguishes normal images from those with retinal abnormalities. the algorithm performance is characterized by testing on an existing database. we were able to diagnose conditions with an average sensitivity of 86%. our system has been designed to be used by ophthalmologists, general practitioners, emergency room physicians, and other health care personnel alike. the emphasis of this paper is not only on devising a detection algorithm for diabetic retinopathy, but more so on the development and utility of a novel system for diagnosis. through this mobile eye-examination system, we envision making the early screening of diabetic retinopathy accessible, especially to rural regions in developing countries, where dedicated ophthalmology centers are expensive, and to alleviate detection in early stages. © 2013 icst.},

  abstract        = {the mobile app market is enjoying an explosive growth. many people, including teenagers, set about developing mobile apps. unfortunately, due to developers' inexperience and the unique mobile programming paradigms, a growing number of immature apps are released to users. despite having useful functionalities, these apps exhibit disruptive behaviors that are inconsiderate to the mobile system as a whole, e.g., retrying network connections too aggressively, waking up the device too frequently, or holding resources for unnecessarily long. these behaviors adversely affect other apps running on the same device and frustrate users with battery drain, excessive cellular data consumption, storage overuse, etc. in this paper, we investigate disruptive app behavior (dab) with a study on 287 real-world dab issues. guided by the study, we present defdroid, a mobile os designed to protect users from the negative impact of dab at runtime. defdroid monitors important app activities and tries to adjust app behaviors using finegrained actions (e.g., enforce back-off to continuous retries, decrease aggressive timer frequency) without breaking app main functionality. our experiments show that defdroid effectively curbs 125 real-world dab cases with small overhead and marginal impact to the usability of both the misbehaving apps and normal apps. during a small-scale user trial, defdroid also found 6 new dab issues. we further deployed defdroid to 185 real users through the phonelab testbed for 43 days and found dab issues from at least 57 apps. © 2016 acm.},

  abstract        = {many a change have been taking place in the technologies and trends in very large scale integration (vlsi) these days. the main factors in vlsi are area, speed and power. as there is a need of low power circuits in all real time applications like consumer electronics, medical applications, and mobile applications. so low power design theme is raised. as this paper introduces a method to reduce power dissipation in digital cmos circuits using power gated dual sub threshold (pgdst) supply voltage. the purpose of this dual supply voltage is some of ultra-low power applications and the circuits with low supply voltages. they did not give satisfactory results with single supply voltage. this secondary supply voltage is assigned for gates, components depends on the critical path and path density in the circuit. power gating technique is applied for corresponding circuit at supply voltage level to reduce power dissipation. this entire work is implemented in mentor graphics back end tool with pyxis schematic 10.3 version on linux operating system. by using this technique high amount of power dissipation is reduced in designed circuits and increases the performance of the designed circuits. © 2015 ieee.},

  abstract        = {usability is one of the critical success factors for mobile applications. however, usability is not easy to improve. many usability testing studies have been conducted to detect usability problems easily, however they usually carry a substantial cost and require specific expertise. in this paper, we present methods and tools to detect usability problems effectively via usability testing in mobile application. we expect users to interact with mobile applications in dissimilar ways when encountering usability problems. based on this approach, we propose tracing, modeling and comparing methods for measuring the similarity of user behaviors. we evaluate the similarity of user behavior and use it in detecting problems. in addition, we developed tools for our methods to run in automatic way to save usability testing costs. an experiment was conducted using two mobile applications to confirm that our proposed method is useful. we tested eight tasks and found lower similarity when users encountered a usability problem. the experimental results show that our methods and tools can help find usability problems in mobile applications. © 2019},

  abstract        = {the android operating system dominates the smartphone market. thus, to service the market, the number of android applications has risen dramatically. these applications are processing a great amount of sensitive data, which could result in various concerns including data leakage and privacy violations. for example, applications may misuse the sensitive data stored on android devices and violate the privacy of the user. therefore, it is essential to maintain user privacy and protect sensitive data from leakage. static data flow analysis approaches are used for analyzing android applications to uncover security and privacy issues. however, these approaches frequently generate false alarms, given the different challenges created by android applications, such as inter-component communication (icc), reflection, and implicit flow. this work presents the droidrista approach for conducting static data flow analysis on android applications to detect sensitive data leakage. droidrista analyzes icc, reflection, and implicit flow in android applications. to evaluate the performance of droidrista, it was tested on three data sets. the results demonstrate improved performance in terms of detecting data leakage compared to existing static data flow analysis approaches. © 2019, springer-verlag gmbh germany, part of springer nature.},

  abstract        = {dynamic program slicing is useful for a variety of tasks, from testing to debugging to security. prior slicing approaches have targeted traditional desktop/server platforms, rather than mobile platforms such as android. slicing mobile, event-based systems is challenging due to their asynchronous callback construction and the ipc (interprocess communication)- heavy, sensor-driven, timing-sensitive nature of the platform. to address these problems, we introduce androidslicer1, the first slicing approach for android. androidslicer combines a novel asynchronous slicing approach for modeling data and control dependences in the presence of callbacks with lightweight and precise instrumentation; this allows slicing for apps running on actual phones, and without requiring the app's source code. our slicer is capable of handling a wide array of inputs that android supports without adding any noticeable overhead. experiments on 60 apps from google play show that androidslicer is effective (reducing the number of instructions to be examined to 0.3% of executed instructions) and efficient (app instrumentation and post-processing combined takes 31 seconds); all while imposing a runtime overhead of just 4%. we present three applications of androidslicer that are particularly relevant in the mobile domain: (1) finding and tracking input parts responsible for an error/crash, (2) fault localization, i.e., finding the instructions responsible for an error/crash, and (3) reducing the regression test suite. experiments with these applications on an additional set of 18 popular apps indicate that androidslicer is effective for android testing and debugging. © 2019 ieee.},

  abstract        = {the energy consumption of mobile apps is a trending topic and researchers are actively investigating the role of coding practices on energy consumption. recent studies suggest that design choices can conflict with energy consumption. therefore, it is important to take into account energy consumption when evolving the design of a mobile app. in this paper, we analyze the impact of eight type of anti-patterns on a testbed of 20 android apps extracted from f-droid. we propose earmo, a novel anti-pattern correction approach that accounts for energy consumption when refactoring mobile anti-patterns. we evaluate earmo using three multiobjective search-based algorithms. the obtained results show that earmo can generate refactoring recommendations in less than a minute, and remove a median of 84 percent of anti-patterns. moreover, earmo extended the battery life of a mobile phone by up to 29 minutes when running in isolation a refactored multimedia app with default settings (no wi-fi, no location services, and minimum screen brightness). finally, we conducted a qualitative study with developers of our studied apps, to assess the refactoring recommendations made by earmo. developers found 68 percent of refactorings suggested by earmo to be very relevant. © 1976-2012 ieee.},

  abstract        = {background: since the beginning of the ebola outbreak in west africa in 2014, more than 11,000 people died. for outbreaks of infectious diseases like this, the rapid implementation of control measures is a crucial factor for containment. in west african countries, outbreak surveillance is a paper-based process with significant delays in forwarding outbreak information, which affects the ability to react adequately to situational changes. our objective therefore was to develop a tool that improves data collection, situation assessment, and coordination of response measures in outbreak surveillance processes for a better containment. methods: we have developed the surveillance and outbreak response management system (sormas) based on findings from nigeria's 2014 ebola outbreak. we conducted a thorough requirements engineering and defined personas and processes. we also defined a data schema with specific variables to measure in outbreak situations. we designed our system to be a cloud application that consists of interfaces for both mobile devices and desktop computers to support all stakeholders in the process. in the field, health workers collect data on the outbreak situation via mobile applications and directly transmit it to control centers. at the control centers, health workers access sormas via desktop computers, receive instant updates on critical situations, react immediately on emergencies, and coordinate the implementation of control measures with sormas. results: we have tested sormas in multiple workshops and a field study in july 2015. results from workshops confirmed derived requirements and implemented features, but also led to further iterations on the systems regarding usability. results from the field study are currently under assessment. general feedback showed high enthusiasm about the system and stressed its benefits for an effective outbreak containment of infectious diseases. conclusions: sormas is a software tool to support health workers in efficiently handling outbreak situations of infectious diseases, such as ebola. our tool enables a bi-directional exchange of situational data between individual stakeholders in outbreak containment. this allows instant and seamless collection of data from the field and its instantaneous analysis in operational centers. by that, sormas accelerates the implementation of control measures, which is crucial for a successful outbreak containment. © 2018 perscheid, benzler, hermann, janke, moyer, laedtke, adeoye, denecke, kirchner, beermann, schwarz, tom-aba and krause.},

  abstract      = {usability is about to become the quality measure of today's interactive software including web sites, and mobile appliances. user-centered design approach emerges from this need for developing more usable products. however, interactive systems are still designed and tested by software and computer engineers unfamiliar with ucd and the related usability engineering techniques. while most software developers may have been exposed with basic concepts such as gui design guidelines, few developers are able to understand the human/user-centered design (ucd) toolbox at a level that allows them to incorporate it into the software development lifecycle. this paper describes an approach for skilling developers and students enrolled in an engineering program in critical user-centered design techniques and tools. the proposed approach starts from the analysis of the usability and software engineer's work context, identifies' critical ucd skills and then associates relevant learning resources with each of the identified skills. our approach suggests a list of patterns for facilitating the integration the ucd skills into the software engineering lifecycle.},

  abstract      = {individuals with permanent cognitive impairment need to be evaluated and monitored. there exists a number of clinically validated cognitive assessment tools, but they often need to be administered by trained therapists in clinical settings. this serves as a major barrier for frequent, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function. in this work, we introduce neuro-world, a collection of innovative 3d mobile games, that allows one to self-administer the assessment of his/her cognitive function. the game performance is analyzed and converted into a clinically-accepted measure of cognitive function, specifically the mini mental state examination (mmse) score, improving the translational impact of the system in real-world clinical settings. to validate the feasibility of our approach, we collected game-specific performance data from 12 post-stroke patients, which was used to train a supervised machine learning model to estimate the corresponding mmse score. our experiment results showed a normalized root mean square error of 5.3% between the actual and estimated mmse scores. this study enables new clinical and research opportunities for accurate longitudinal assessment of cognitive function via an interactive means of playing mobile games. © 2018 ieee.},

  abstract        = {background ankle sprain is the most common sports-related injury, and approximately 80% of patients studied suffered recurrent sprains. these repeated ankle injuries could cause chronic ankle instability, a decrease in sports performance, and a decrease in postural control ability. at the present time, smartphones have become very popular and powerful devices, and smartphone applications (apps) that have been shown to have good validity have been designed to measure human body motion. however, the app focusing on ankle function assessment and rehabilitation is still not widely used and has very limited functions. the purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of smartphone-based systems in the assessment of postural control ability for patients with chronic ankle instability. methods fifteen physically active adults (6 male, 9 female; aged = 23.4 ± 5.28 years; height = 167.13 ± 7.3 cm; weight = 62.06 ± 10.82 kg; bmi = 22.08 ± 2.57 kg/ m2) were recruited, and these participants had at least one leg that was evaluated as scoring lower than 27 points according to the cumberland ankle instability tool (cait). the smartphone used in the study was asus zenfone 2, and an app developed using mit app inventor was used to record built-in accelerometer data during the assessment process. subjects were asked to perform single leg stance for 20 s in eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions with each leg. the smartphone was fixed in an upright position on the middle of the shin, using an exercise armband, with the screen facing forward. the average of recorded acceleration data was used to represent the postural control performance, and higher values indicated more instability. data were analyzed with a paired t-test with spss 17.0, and the statistical significance was set as alpha &lt;0.05. results a significant difference was found between cait scores from the healthier leg and injured leg (healthier leg 23.07 ± 3.80 vs. injured leg 18.27 ± 3.92, p &lt; 0.001). significant differences were also found between the scores for the healthier leg and injured leg during both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions (eyes-open: healthier leg 0.051 ± 0.018 vs. injured leg 0.072 ± 0.034, p = 0.027; eyes-closed: healthier leg 0.100 ± 0.031 vs. injured leg 0.123 ± 0.038, p = 0.001, unit: m/s2). significant differences were also found between eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions during both single leg standing with healthier leg and injured leg (healthier leg: eyes-open 0.051 ± 0.018 vs. eyes-closed 0.100 ± 0.031, p &lt; 0.001; injured leg: eyes-open 0.072 ± 0.034 vs. eyes-closed 0.123 ± 0.038, p = 0.001, unit: m/s2). the results demonstrate that the smartphone software can be used to discriminate between the different performances of the healthier leg and injured leg, and also between eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. conclusion the smartphone may have the potential to be a convenient, easy-to-use, and feasible tool for the assessment of postural control ability on subjects with chronic ankle instability. © 2016 elsevier ireland ltd},

  abstract        = {computational offloading can improve user experience of mobile apps through improved responsiveness and reduced energy footprint. a fundamental challenge in offloading is to distinguish situations where offloading is beneficial from those where it is counterproductive. currently, offloading decisions are predominantly based on profiling performed on individual devices. while significant gains have been shown in benchmarks, these gains rarely translate to real-world use due to the complexity of contexts and parameters that affect offloading. we contribute by proposing crowdsensed evidence traces as a novel mechanism for improving the performance of offloading systems. instead of limiting to profiling individual devices, crowdsensing enables characterizing execution contexts across a community of users, providing better generalisation and coverage of contexts. we demonstrate the feasibility of using crowdsensing to characterize offloading contexts through an analysis of two crowdsensing datasets. motivated by our results, we present the design and development of the emco toolkit and platform as a novel solution for computational offloading. experiments carried out on a testbed deployment in amazon ec2 ireland demonstrate that emco can consistently accelerate app execution while at the same time reduce energy footprint. we also demonstrate that emco provides better scalability than current cloud platforms, being able to serve a larger number of clients without variations in performance. our framework, use cases, and tools are available as open source from github. © 2002-2012 ieee.},

  abstract      = {objective: this study investigated the processes leading to enjoyment of casual videogames on both mobile devices and console systems. building upon a foundation in mental models theory and the psychology of play, the study focuses on how performance and experience-based variables impact enjoyment of casual videogames played on mobile devices and console devices. the grounding assumption of this research is that playing videogames produces enjoyment that contributes to mental health in the form of a brief distraction from the stress of daily life, social connections with family and friends through casual gameplay, and, in some cases, a compelling reason to engage in physical activity. materials and methods: a student sample of players (n=363) played a variety of casual games on mobile (ipad® or ipod® touch® [apple, cupertino, ca]) or console (wii™ [nintendo, japan], xbox® 360 kinect® [microsoft, redmond, wa], or ps3™ move [sony, tokyo, japan]) platforms. they then answered a questionnaire assessing their evaluations of the game's interactivity level, their sense of spatial presence in the game, their perception of the game's realism, and, most importantly, their enjoyment. path analysis demonstrated the interrelationships among these variables. results: the results show that spatial presence is a powerful predictor of videogame enjoyment for both console- and mobile-based casual games. patterns of prediction for games on each platform, as demonstrated using path analysis, were similar and aligned with predictions based on mental models and the psychology of play. conclusions: the psychological theory of play and the mental models perspective offer firm theoretical grounds for understanding how enjoyment is wrought in the process of playing casual games. the relationships among interactivity, spatial presence, perceived reality, and enjoyment hold for games played on handheld or console devices. furthermore, this study is one of the first to demonstrate these relationships and test them simultaneously, breaking new ground in research on game enjoyment. © copyright 2015, mary ann liebert, inc.},

  abstract        = {this paper proposes a solution for automated goal-driven exploration of android applications-a scenario in which a user, e.g., a security auditor, needs to dynamically trigger the functionality of interest in an application, e.g., to check whether user-sensitive info is only sent to recognized third-party servers. as the auditor might need to check hundreds or even thousands of apps, manually exploring each app to trigger the desired behavior is too time-consuming to be feasible. existing automated application exploration and testing techniques are of limited help in this scenario as well, as their goal is mostly to identify faults by systematically exploring different app paths, rather than swiftly navigating to the target functionality. the goal-driven application exploration approach proposed in this paper, called goalexplorer, automatically generates an executable test script that directly triggers the functionality of interest. the core idea behind goalexplorer is to first statically model the application's ui screens and transitions between these screens, producing a screen transition graph (stg). then, goalexplorer uses the stg to guide the dynamic exploration of the application to the particular target of interest: an android activity, api call, or a program statement. the results of our empirical evaluation on 93 benchmark applications and the 95 most popular googleplay applications show that the stg is substantially more accurate than other android ui models and that goalexplorer is able to trigger a target functionality much faster than existing application exploration techniques. © 2019 ieee.},

  abstract        = {a critical quality factor for smartphone apps is responsiveness, which indicates how fast an app reacts to user actions. a soft hang occurs when the app’s response time of handling a certain user action is longer than a user-perceivable delay. soft hangs can be caused by normal user interface (ui) rendering or some blocking operations that should not be conducted on the app’s main thread (i.e., soft hang bugs). existing solutions on soft hang bug detection focus mainly on offline app code examination to find previously known blocking operations and then move them off the main thread. unfortunately, such offline solutions can fail to identify blocking operations that are previously unknown or hidden in libraries. in this paper, we present hang doctor, a runtime methodology that supplements the existing offline algorithms by detecting and diagnosing soft hangs caused by previously unknown blocking operations. hang doctor features a two-phase algorithm that first checks response time and performance event counters for detecting possible soft hang bugs with small overheads, and then performs stack trace analysis when diagnosis is necessary. a novel soft hang filter based on correlation analysis is designed to minimize false positives and negatives for high detection performance and low overhead. we have implemented a prototype of hang doctor and tested it with the latest releases of 114 real-world apps. hang doctor has identified 34 new soft hang bugs that are previously unknown to their developers, among which 62%, so far, have been confirmed by the developers, and 68% are missed by offline algorithms. © 2018 association for computing machinery.},

  abstract      = {mobile cloud computing enables mobile devices to augment their computational capabilities with centralized resources. however, due to latency issues, mobile cloud computing is unsuitable in many situations. lately, mobile edge computing appeared as a more decentralized paradigm, which utilizes nearby resources. it benefits from the continuously increasing amount and the enhancing performance of end-user devices. compared to mobile cloud computing, nearby resources are limited, but reachable with a significantly shorter latency. we argue that a combination of both approaches can drastically improve the performance of mobile applications. in this paper, we introduce a hybrid scheduling approach. beyond centralized scheduling on remote edge and cloud resources, we introduce an ad-hoc scheduling mechanism on nearby edge devices. our context-aware scheduler considers both options along with the characteristics of the task to decide between an execution in the cloud or in the edge. we use mechanisms for edge device discovery, connection management, and task allocation as well as a context-aware utility function. we integrate our approach into an existing distributed computing system and evaluate the hybrid scheduler within a real-world testbed. © 2018 ieee.},

  abstract      = {the volume of traffic belonging to mobile applications over the internet has already crossed the traffic generated due to traditional desktop-based internet browsing. to protect security and privacy of the mobile user, many smartphone applications use encryption to encapsulates communications over the internet. however it is not possible to decode the actual message contents, even then the statistical information present in the traffic is useful to identify application and the associated activity. this paper proposes a machine learning based framework to analyze the encrypted mobile traffic with the objective of finding the mobile application usage patterns of smartphone users. this information can be used by various authorities to profile mobile users with respect to their age, gender profession, etc. which would further help them to look for any suspicious or anomalous behaviour. proposed framework has been tested on the network traffic data pertaining to popular smartphone applications such as gmail, facebook, and youtube and have achieved 97.46% accuracy for application identification. further, the proposed framework also achieved a fairly high accuracy, 77.37% when used for the classification of exact activity performed by the smartphone user in different applications. © 2020 ieee.},

  abstract        = {mobile applications have the potential to significantly change the way businesses interact with external stakeholders. our review of previous literature, however, reveals a paucity of academic research on factors that facilitate or impede adoption and implementation from providers' perspective. grounded in the taxonomy of the technology-organization-environment (toe) framework, this paper addresses this gap by deriving a sme-focused it assimilation model. framed by qualitative data obtained from ten semi-structured interviews, the proposed model incorporates six contextual factors that determine two distinct it assimilation stages: (1) initial adoption decisions and (2) degree of integration into value chain activities (i.e., extent of adoption). our paper thereby provides a balanced view between initial adoption and subsequent implementation. we are thereby able to contribute to a profound understanding of the link between post-adoption variations in it usage and business value creation. the proposed model is tested against data collected from 214 smes using logistic regression and structural equation modeling. © 40th international conference on information systems, icis 2019. all rights reserved.},

  abstract        = {the evaluation of systems or artifacts as “outcomes” of software engineering (se) projects has been a focus of study in se-related research for quite some time. in recent years, evaluating artifacts, for example, mobile applications or websites has become more important, since such artifacts play increasingly critical roles in generating revenues for businesses, and the degree of artifact effectiveness is seen as a competitive factor. with the teds framework/procedure a novel and comprehensive approach to systematic artifact evaluation and comparison had been presented a few years ago, whose effectiveness and analytical power in comprehensive and highly detailed artifact evaluations and comparisons was empirically shown; however, despite its demonstrated capability teds still proved to be time and resource consuming like other evaluation approaches before. in order to overcome these constraints and provide evaluative feedback more quickly to developers and service providers, tedsrate, a web-based evaluation tool employing the teds framework/procedure, was developed. the tool was tested with two real-world organizations, the city of seattle emergency operations center (eoc) and the seattle sounders football club. the tests suggest that the highly configurable tedsrate tool can fully implement and administer the teds framework/procedure and, at the same time, provide instantaneous, cost-effective, comprehensive, and highly detailed artifact evaluations to both developers and service providers. © 2017, ifip international federation for information processing.},

  abstract        = {the distinction between field and laboratory is classical in research methodology. in human-computer interaction, and in usability evaluation in particular, it has been a controversial topic for several years. the advent of mobile devices has revived this topic. empirical studies that compare evaluations in the two settings are beginning to appear, but they provide very different results. this paper presents results from an experimental comparison of a field-based and a lab-based usability evaluation of a mobile system. the two evaluations were conducted in exactly the same way. the conclusion is that it is definitely worth the hassle to conduct usability evaluations in the field. in the field-based evaluation we identified significantly more usability problems and this setting revealed problems with interaction style and cognitive load that were not identified in the laboratory. copyright 2006 acm.},

  abstract        = {introduction: as high amounts of occupational sitting have been associated with negative health consequences, designing workplace interventions to reduce sedentary behaviour (sb) is of public health interest. digital technology may serve as a cost-effective and scalable platform to deliver such an intervention. this study describes the iterative development of a theory-based, digital behaviour change intervention to reduce occupational sb. methods: the behaviour change wheel and the behaviour change technique taxonomy were used to guide the intervention design process and form a basis for selecting the intervention components. the development process consisted of four phases: phase 1 – preliminary research, phase 2 – consensus workshops, phase 3 – white boarding and phase 4 – usability testing. results: the process led to the development and refinement of a smartphone application – worktivity. the core component was self-monitoring and feedback of sb at work, complemented by additional features focusing on goal setting, prompts and reminders to break up prolonged periods of sitting, and educational facts and tips. key features of the app included simple data entry and personalisation based on each individual’s self-reported sitting time. results from the ‘think-aloud’ interviews (n=5) suggest worktivity was well accepted and that users were positive about its features. conclusion: this study led to the development of worktivity, a theory-based and user-informed mobile app intervention to reduce occupational sb. it is the first app of its kind developed with the primary aim of reducing occupational sb using digital self-monitoring. this paper provides a template to guide others in the development and evaluation of technology-supported behaviour change interventions. © the author(s) 2020.},

  abstract        = {by increasing growth of mobile applications, providing their security has become significant. among mobile operating systems, android is the most popular one, and hence, it has drawn more attention from malware programmers. one of the main challenges in designing a malware detection mechanism is handling obfuscation, where malware programmers try to change malware codes, such that they cannot be detected by malware detectors, while they keep their functionalities. in this paper, we propose an obfuscation-resilient method, called ordroid, which can detect mutated and transformed malwares. we have used rnn and nlp neural networks for achieving this purpose. our assumption is that the model is run on a server, before the application is published for end users. users may get an application from different sources, and hence, it is necessary to design methods that can run on end users’ mobile phones. the challenge that should be considered when designing such methods is the limitation of computation and energy resources on a mobile phone. in the second part of this paper, we propose a lightweight malware detection method, called lightdroid. the main idea of this method is to select a minimal number of features from androidmanifest file, along with a number of picture-based features from dalvik executable file in a way that the accuracy of the resulting model is close to the state-of-the-art methods, while its complexity is as low as possible. we have fully implemented our proposed methods, as well as some of the state-of-the-art methods, including drebin and revealdroid. the results show that lightdroid is the most lightweight one, with 97.49% accuracy on the test data. evaluation of ordroid shows that, considering the overall accuracy of both test and transformed data, our model is the best comparing to the most related methods with the accuracy of 98.07% on the normal and 93.00% on the transformed data. © 2019, springer-verlag france sas, part of springer nature.},

  abstract        = {cloud apps like google docs and trello are popular because they enable real-time collaboration with colleagues, and they make it easy for us to access our work from all of our devices. however, by centralizing data storage on servers, cloud apps also take away ownership and agency from users. if a service shuts down, the software stops functioning, and data created with that software is lost. in this article we propose local-first software, a set of principles for software that enables both collaboration and ownership for users. local-first ideals include the ability to work offline and collaborate across multiple devices, while also improving the security, privacy, long-term preservation, and user control of data. we survey existing approaches to data storage and sharing, ranging from email attachments to web apps to firebase-backed mobile apps, and we examine the trade-offs of each. we look at conflict-free replicated data types (crdts): data structures that are multi-user from the ground up while also being fundamentally local and private. crdts have the potential to be a foundational technology for realizing local-first software. we share some of our findings from developing local-first software prototypes at the ink & switch research lab over the course of several years. these experiments test the viability of crdts in practice, and explore the user interface challenges for this new data model. lastly, we suggest some next steps for moving towards local-first software: for researchers, for app developers, and a startup opportunity for entrepreneurs. © 2019 copyright held by the owner/author(s). publication rights licensed to acm.},

  abstract        = {in the past few decades, smartphones and global positioning system(gps) devices have led to the popularity of location based services. it is crucial for large mncs to get a lot of data from people and provide their services accordingly. however, on the other side, the concern of privacy has also increased among the users, and they would like to hide their whereabouts. the rise of data consumption and the hunger for faster network speed has also led to the emergence of new concepts such as the fog computing. fog computing paradigm extends the storage, networking, and computing facilities of the cloud computing towards the edge of the networks while removing the load on the server centers and decreasing the latency at the edge device. the fog computing will help in unlimited growth of location services and this adoption of fog computing calls for the need for more secure and robust algorithms for location privacy. one of the ways we can alter the information regarding the location of the user is location obfuscation. this can be done reversibly or irreversibly. in this paper, we address the problem of location privacy and present a solution based on the type of data that has to be preserved (in our case, it is distance). a mobile application has been designed and developed to test and validate the feasibility of the proposed obfuscation techniques for the fog computing environments. © 2019 ieee.},

  abstract        = {cerebral palsy is a common neurodevelopmental condition. the condition may present itself in many different kinds of classification. cerebral palsy is always showing many deficits such as mental retardation, speech, language and motor problems. this research was inspired from elisya, a nine-year-old girl with cerebral palsy since born with an auditory and speech disorder including motor problem that affects her mobility. her senses and brain do not fully coordinate and this creates a communication issue between elisya and her parents. the aim of this research is to provide a mean for children with cerebral palsy who can’t speak to communicate significantly with their parents and carers without using any sign language. there are plenty of assistive tools in the market and this includes the augmentative and alternative communication devices for people with speech disorders. however, there is no app found in malay language and the content can’t be personalized. make me speak is an augmentative and alternative communication tool using mobile technology which is developed to help people with cerebral palsy to communicate with people around them. make me speak is not just for cerebral palsy community but for anyone with speech disorder. it is developed in dual language – malay and english with a personalized content. react native mobile development platform is used to create the app. react native helps in building cross platform mobile apps. hence, it saves time and cost to build mobile apps on multiple platforms. usability test was done on elisya and it was found that she is able to manage the app and chose the right buttons to express her needs. this research is in line with the social innovation initiative for people with disabilities as described in the eleventh malaysia plan (rmk-11). © 2019, world academy of research in science and engineering. all rights reserved.},

  abstract        = {high frequency oscillations (hfos) are electroencephalographic correlates of brain activity detectable in a frequency range above 80 hz. they co-occur with physiological processes such as saccades, movement execution, and memory formation, but are also related to pathological processes in patients with epilepsy. localization of the seizure onset zone, and, more specifically, of the to-be resected area in patients with refractory epilepsy seems to be supported by the detection of hfos. the visual identification of hfos is very time consuming with approximately 8 h for 10 min and 20 channels. therefore, automated detection of hfos is highly warranted. so far, no software for visual marking or automated detection of hfos meets the needs of everyday clinical practice and research. in the context of the currently available tools and for the purpose of related local hfo study activities we aimed at converging the advantages of clinical and experimental systems by designing and developing a comprehensive and extensible software framework for hfo analysis that, on the one hand, focuses on the requirements of clinical application and, on the other hand, facilitates the integration of experimental code and algorithms. the development project included the definition of use cases, specification of requirements, software design, implementation, and integration. the work comprised the engineering of component-specific requirements, component design, as well as component- and integration-tests. a functional and tested software package is the deliverable of this activity. the project meegips, a modular eeg investigation and processing system for visual and automated detection of hfos, introduces a highly user friendly software that includes five of the most prominent automated detection algorithms. future evaluation of these, as well as implementation of further algorithms is facilitated by the modular software architecture. © 2019 höller, trinka and höller.},

  abstract        = {this paper proposes mimic, an automated ui compatibility testing system for android apps. mimic is designed specifically for comparing the ui behavior of an app across different devices, different android versions, and different app versions. this design choice stems from a common problem that android developers and researchers face-how to test whether or not an app behaves consistently across different environments or internal changes. mimic allows android app developers to easily perform backward and forward compatibility testing for their apps. it also enables a clear comparison between a stable version of app and a newer version of app. in doing so, mimic allows multiple testing strategies to be used, such as randomized or sequential testing. finally, mimic programming model allows such tests to be scripted with much less developer effort than other comparable systems. additionally, mimic allows parallel testing with multiple testing devices and thereby speeds up testing time. to demonstrate these capabilities, we perform extensive tests for each of the scenarios described above. our results show that mimic is effective in detecting forward and backward compatibility issues, and verify runtime behavior of apps. our evaluation also shows that mimic significantly reduces the development burden for developers. © 2019 ieee.},

  abstract        = {mobile computing is one of the largest untapped reservoirs in today's pervasive computing world as it has the potential to enable a variety of in-situ, real-time applications. yet, this computing paradigm suffers when the available resources - such as device battery, cpu cycles, memory, i/o data rate - are limited. in this paper, the new paradigm of approximate computing is proposed to harness such potential and to enable real-time computation-intensive mobile applications in resource-limited and uncertain environments. a reduction in time and energy consumed by an application is obtained via approximate computing by decreasing the amount of computation needed by different tasks in an application; such improvement, however, comes with the potential loss in accuracy. hence, a mobile distributed computing framework, mobidic, is introduced to determine offline the 'approximable' tasks in an application and a light-weight algorithm is devised to select the approximate version of the tasks in an application during run-time. the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through extensive simulation and testbed experiments by comparing approximate versus exact-computation performance. © 2016 ieee.},

  abstract        = {purpose: people with severe or profound hearing loss face daily communication problems mainly due to the language barrier between themselves and the hearing community. their hearing deficiency, as well as their use of sign language, often makes it difficult for them to use and understand spoken language. cyprus is amongst the top 5 european countries with a relatively high proportion of registered deaf people (0.12 per cent of the population: gul, 2010). however, lack of technological and financial support to the deaf community of cyprus leaves the cypriot deaf people unsupported and marginalised. the paper aims to discuss this issue. design/methodology/approach: this study implemented user-centred design methods to explore the communication needs and requirements of cypriot deaf people and develop a functional prototype of a mobile app to help them to communicate more effectively with hearing people. a total of 76 deaf adults were involved in various stages of the research. this paper presents the participatory design activities (n=8) and results of usability testing (n=8). findings: the study found that users were completely satisfied with the mobile app and, in particular, they liked the use of cypriot sign language (csl) videos of a real person interpreting hearing people’s speech in real time and the custom onscreen keyboard to allow faster selection of text input. originality/value: despite advances in communication aid technologies, there is currently no technology available that supports csl or real-time speech to sign language conversion for the deaf people of cyprus. © 2019, emerald publishing limited.},

  abstract        = {in the era of an internet of things, pattern recognition technology is growing rapidly, especially by the massive implementations of artificial intelligence (ai). selecting the right implementation for an ai algorithm for an application could be quite challenging and time-consuming. in this paper, we propose a client-server system implementation for handwriting digit recognition. a client-server is set based on tensorflow with multiple models for classifications. the client is set based on a mobile application that the user inputs the digit by touch panel of the mobile. in this paper, the models at the server are trained and tested by using mnist database of handwritten. in addition, we use convolutional neural network (cnn) to improve the performance of the neural network. the client-server allows many users to be accessed by ai model from the same time. the advantage of using client-server approach is reducing power and time for processing handwriting recognition in client device. it also speeds up the time of development and implementation of algorithm on the server. © 2019 ieee.},

  abstract        = {mobile virtual reality (vr) is increasingly becoming popular and accessible to everyone that holds a smartphone. in particular, digital didactics can take advantage of natural interaction and immersion in virtual environments, starting from primary education. this paper investigates the problem of enhancing music learning in primary education through the use of mobile vr. to this end, technical and methodological frameworks were developed, and were tested with two classes in the last year of a primary school (10 years old children). the classes were involved in an evaluation study on music genre identification and learning with a multi-platform mobile application called vr4edu. students were immersed in music performances of different genres (e.g., classical, country, jazz, and swing), navigating inside several musical rooms. the evaluation of the didactic protocol shows a statistically significant improvement in learning genre characterization (i.e., typical instruments and their spatial arrangements on stage) compared to traditional lessons with printed materials and passive listening. these results show that the use of mobile vr technologies in synergy with traditional teaching methodologies can improve the music learning experience in primary education, in terms of active listening, attention, and time. the inclusion of pupils with certified special needs strengthened our results. © 2019 elsevier ltd},

  abstract        = {a significant part in the field of physical activity is represented by aerobic endurance training due to the fact that it depends primarily on aerobic energy generating processes. the stress of aerobic workout induces adaptations in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems which generate an optimal output of performance. maintaining the heart rate and breathing at a set value of intensity, determined by the individual's unique characteristics, is one way of enhancing the performance output of training. determining these operating points that ensure desired results are often hard to calculate with classical methods, especially in the presence of nonlinearity of the heart rate variability. this paper presents a mobile application, motion-ae, designed for setting the optimal intensity of the aerobic endurance training, using an intelligent decision making method. the software application was tested and validated using data from various subjects. the designed mobile application takes into account the individual's unique characteristics and ensures the optimal intensity of the training session, finding its usefulness in supporting the configuration process of training parameters by specialized professionals. © 2016 [international journal of artificial intelligence].},

  abstract        = {in recent years, institutions of higher education have been using massive open online courses (moocs) as an alternative to enhance and innovate traditional classroom practices. one of the approaches to this type of innovation consists of using the platforms where moocs are hosted for the development of courses that are aligned to their on-campus curricular contents. they are known as small private online courses (spocs), which allow online access to knowledge for groups of students with a well-defined profile. the platforms where moocs (and spocs) are hosted have been designed to support large volumes of data and visits. however, these platforms present important limitations regarding the implementation of collaborative learning activities. to address this problem, this article presents mymoocspace, a cloud-based mobile system aimed at supporting effective collaboration in moocs, by combining key aspects of collaboration from the research area of computer supported collaborative learning (cscl) with game-based dynamics. mymoocspace has been tested in three quasi-experiments that were run in four latin-american universities with a total of 68 participants. the objective was to assess its usability and its effect in enhancing collaboration among students in a spoc. the results obtained on usability show that mymoocspace is easy to use, and that participants felt pleased with while using it. finally, it was observed that mymoocspace managed to enhance interaction and collaboration among students. © 2017 wiley periodicals, inc.},

  abstract        = {the rfid technology is becoming ever more popular in the development of ubiquitous computing applications. a full exploitation of the rfid potential requires the study and implementation of human-computer interaction (hci) modalities to be able to support wide usability by the target audience. this implies the need for programming methodologies specifically dedicated to support the easy and efficient prototyping of applications to have feedback from early tests with users. on the basis of our field-working experience, we have designed odect, a high-level language and platform-independent application programming interface (api), ad hoc designed to meet the needs of typical applications for mobile devices (smart phones and pdas). odect aims at allowing application developers to create their prototypes focusing on the needs of the final users, without having to care about the low-level software that interacts with the rfid hardware. further, in an end-user developing (eud) approach, odect provides specific support for the application end-user herself to cope with typical problems of rfid applications in detecting objects. we describe in detail the features of the api and discuss the findings of a test with four programmers, where we analyse and evaluate the use of the api in four sample applications. we also present results of an end-user test, which investigated strengths and weaknesses of the territorial agenda (ta) concept. the ta is an rfid-based citizen guide that aids-through time- and location-based reminders-users in their daily activities in a city. the ta directly exploits eud features of odect, in particular concerning the possibility of linking detected objects with custom actions. copyright © 2008 john wiley & sons, ltd.},

  abstract        = {background and objective: glaucoma, an eye condition that leads to permanent blindness, is typically asymptomatic and therefore difficult to be diagnosed in time. however, if diagnosed in time, glaucoma can effectively be slowed down by using adequate treatment; hence, an early diagnosis is of utmost importance. nonetheless, the conventional approaches to diagnose glaucoma adopt expensive and bulky equipment that requires qualified experts, making it difficult, costly and time-consuming to diagnose large amounts of people. consequently, new alternatives to diagnose glaucoma that suppress these issues should be explored. methods: this work proposes an interpretable computer-aided diagnosis (cad) pipeline that is capable of diagnosing glaucoma using fundus images and run offline in mobile devices. several public datasets of fundus images were merged and used to build convolutional neural networks (cnns) that perform segmentation and classification tasks. these networks are then used to build a pipeline for glaucoma assessment that outputs a glaucoma confidence level and also provides several morphological features and segmentations of relevant structures, resulting in an interpretable glaucoma diagnosis. to assess the performance of this method in a restricted environment, this pipeline was integrated into a mobile application and time and space complexities were assessed. results: considering the test set, the developed pipeline achieved 0.91 and 0.75 of intersection over union (iou) in the optic disc and optic cup segmentation, respectively. with regards to the classification, an accuracy of 0.87 with a sensitivity of 0.85 and an auc of 0.93 were attained. moreover, this pipeline runs on an average android smartphone in under two seconds. conclusions: the results demonstrate the potential that this method can have in the contribution to an early glaucoma diagnosis. the proposed approach achieved similar or slightly better metrics than the current cad systems for glaucoma assessment while running on more restricted devices. this pipeline can, therefore, be used to construct accurate and affordable cad systems that could enable large glaucoma screenings, contributing to an earlier diagnose of this condition. © 2020},

  abstract        = {in the internet of things (iot) environment, objects are connected on a network to share data. however, most of the iot devices are developed and deployed with poor security consideration. as a result, these devices become a target of attacks. a solution for ensuring the safety and security of a network system is penetration testing. in this study, we propose a framework for automated and flexible penetration testing for iot network. most of the available penetration testing methods are experts based, that select tool and process manually. this kind of pen-test is a costly, time-consuming and inefficient. also, the existing automated penetration testing doesn't consider the interaction between system components; it works by testing each component of a system separately. individual component testing can lead to a security gap that makes the pen-test inefficient since many low severity vulnerabilities on different inter-connected components can lead the system to an insecure state. moreover, in some cases testing the individual components can claim that the particular component is secure, but if these individual components are connected in one system, it makes this system insecure. due to such shortages, our framework will test the end-to-end target system (i.e., end devices, wireless communication, the control unit, then communication to the cloud server, and finally communication from the cloud to end user through mobile app or webpage). the proposed framework will automatically gather the information of the target iot network and then perform various kinds of penetration testing through the network. then it will summarize the results of pentest and gives the recommendations to secure the system. © 2019 ieee.},

  abstract        = {with the increasing use of smartphones and mobile applications, users access the internet from everywhere using mobile networks. different applications require different connectivity types or amount of data and a slow network can lead to a drastic degradation in performance. these applications usually access data on servers which are also accessible via other technologies such as websites, web service consumption or restful services on non-mobile clients and to ensure the same service, a single application programming interface (api) is provided. when mobile users access these services, the same traditional techniques such as soap based web services or restful services are used but these are not always appropriate. similarly, the use of current web caching methods do not provide the same performance gain when http based restful services are called from mobile devices. this paper proposes a 2-tier caching proxy system, which can be easily deployed and used by producers and consumers of restful services. this system has been implemented and tested using a live system and performance evaluation showed that a performance gain of up to 59% can be achieved along with a bandwidth reduction of 70% for service providers and 86% for clients. © 2015 ieee.},

  abstract        = {the problem of generating different patterns of traffic to emulate real user behaviour is receiving considerable attention with the construction of new and more complex network architectures. the theoretical modelling of waveforms or signals that flow through networks is valuable in a variety of scenarios including performance analysis and the design of communication systems. in the literature, many computer-based performance evaluation tools have been discussed. however, these tools lack the ability to run on affordable technologies such as mobile phones. the fundamental contribution of this work is the design of a traffic generating tool called mtgawn which is able to run on a mobile device. design science research was the research methodology used for the design and deployment of a prototype of the proposed system. voip traffic was emulated using an implementation of well-known real time transport protocols such as rtp and crtp, and parameterization was defined by using three codecs namely: g.711, g.723, and g.729. an evaluation was performed in a laboratory wireless network testbed and preliminary results were collected and analysed. the results of the experiments show that such a measuring instrument can be deployed on a mobile phone. more experiments are being done to ensure the accuracy of the data and also to compare the results with that of computer-based systems. furthermore additional functionalities, similar to the functionality found on the computer-based open source tools, are being added to the mobile tool.},

  abstract      = {the concept of personal health systems (phs) was introduced in the 1990s as a target activity of the european commission (ec) r&d programme in ehealth following the focus on regional health information networks (rhin). the main scope of both rhin and phs is to contribute to continuity of care and active participation of patients and citizens in the processes of care and disease prevention. phs enable each individual (patient or healthy citizen) to become an "active node" within the health information networks. they build on the integration of information and communication technologies (ict) and components, and aim at the delivery of personalised healthcare at the point of need. phs encompass typically wearable or portable systems for health status monitoring, ict-based telemedicine solutions, as well as personalised mobile applications and algorithms adapted to the circumstances of the individual user. they empower citizens to have a greater role in managing their own health status and enjoy better interaction with medical professionals. phs provide the means to enable prevention or early diagnosis of diseases, as well as more cost-effective patient monitoring and disease management, beyond the ordinary hospital environment. the research and development work that has been carried out so far on phs has focused mostly on non-invasive monitoring of physiological functions and physical activity through e.g., body-worn devices or smart fabrics (intelligent biomedical clothes) with embedded sensing capability. data acquired from the sensors is processed locally and/or remotely following its transmission via e.g. a mobile phone or other portable device to a central server. alarms or warnings can be generated according to the level of measured variables, and feedback can be provided to the user (patient / healthy citizen) either by a health professional or by the monitoring system itself depending on the severity of the condition. the industry has an increasing interest in this field as demonstrated by the establishment of the continua alliance. some phs solutions are now mature enough to seek deployment and implementation in healthcare practice. this is particularly true for solutions aiming at management of chronic diseases, whose burden on healthcare is increasing continuously. creating opportunities for the development of a phs market is becoming a priority of the ec for two major reasons: (i) societal benefits, namely the contribution to quality of care and sustainability of health delivery systems; and (ii) economic benefits through the facilitation of growth and sustainability of an emerging market (devices and telemedicine services). in a recent conference organised by the ec, the challenges for the deployment of phs were discussed. technology is not the biggest barrier to deployment. of course, certain technological aspects like standardisation, interoperability, userfriendliness, reliability and dependability need to be fully addressed so that phs can receive the indispensable support of the users. the major factors that need to be tackled in order to harness the benefits of phs include proper organisational structures; reimbursement and economical viability; legal framework regarding liability, privacy and cross-border services; and regulatory aspects such as certification of phs. the successful deployment of phs requires favourable policy and political support from the same constituency that is designing and implementing the ongoing healthcare systems reforms in eu and beyond. the evidence of benefits of phs will come from the large scale pilots that are supported by ec and national programmes. early evidence from research projects and validation studies demonstrates that: (a) phs contribute to improved patient well-being and quality of care by involving all the relevant stakeholders in the healthcare process, and (b) there are favourable conditions for new organisational approaches which integrate phs into existing or new healthcare delivery models; (c) the phs market has great potential for sustainable growth and competitiveness of industries operating in eu. incentives for promoting healthy life styles, deploying wellness programs and performance-oriented reimbursement can be a powerful mechanism for change. patient empowerment through ict and consumer involvement can also be a strong factor. as consumers gain influence and the right to choice, a consumer orientation for products and services, combined with transparency of the offered services, may be decisive. © 2007 ieee.},

  abstract      = {in order to enable efficient integration of fpgas into cost effective and reliable high-performance systems as well potentially into low power mobile systems, their power efficiency needs to be improved. in this paper, we propose a power management scheme for fpgas centered on a power-driven partitioning technique. our power-driven partitioner creates clusters within a design such that within individual clusters, power consumption can be improved via voltage scaling. we tested the effectiveness of our approach on a set of lut-level benchmark netlists. further we did constrained placement of the clusters into predefined vddhigh and vddlow regions for a single fpga. average savings in power consumption with our approach is 48% whereas penalty in channel width and wire length due to constrained placement is 23% and 26% respectively. © springer-verlag berlin heidelberg 2004.},

  abstract        = {this paper introduces a new, fully automated modelbased approach for effective testing of android apps. different from existing model-based approaches that guide testing with a static gui model (i.e., the model does not evolve its abstraction during testing, and is thus often imprecise), our approach dynamically optimizes the model by leveraging the runtime information during testing. this capability of model evolution significantly improves model precision, and thus dramatically enhances the testing effectiveness compared to existing approaches, which our evaluation confirms.we have realized our technique in a practical tool, ape. on 15 large, widely-used apps from the google play store, ape outperforms the state-of-the-art android gui testing tools in terms of both testing coverage and the number of detected unique crashes. to further demonstrate ape's effectiveness and usability, we conduct another evaluation of ape on 1,316 popular apps, where it found 537 unique crashes. out of the 38 reported crashes, 13 have been fixed and 5 have been confirmed. © 2019 ieee.},

  abstract        = {in this paper, we present a thorough study of voice impersonation attacks that can compromise the security of voice authentication technology deployed in several popular, state-of-the-art android and ios apps. our study is based on our formulated sneakers attack system that comprises a variety of well-known as well as newly designed attacks: (1) recorded and replayed voice of the authorized user (replay attack); (2) reordered and played-back voice of the authorized user (reorder attack); and (3) synthesized voice generated - based on voice conversion techniques - using an unauthorized user's voice (standard conversion attack), or using a noise-free recording from a text-to-speech engine (tts conversion attack). taking sneakers as a basis, we report on a carefully designed study to examine a variety of real-world voice authentication apps for their vulnerability against malicious authentication.our study follows a two-phase methodology. in the preliminary phase, we analyze 8 popular mobile apps against standard simplistic attack setups. our results show that, while the tested apps seem to resist the reorder attack and the standard conversion attack, they are highly vulnerable to the replay attack. in the main phase of the study, we comprehensively assess 5 of the above apps against more advanced newly designed attack setups. like in the preliminary phase, the apps prove to be highly vulnerable to the replay attack. more seriously, the apps also turn out to be highly insecure against our advanced attack setups, i.e., the reorder attack with coordinated timing and the tts conversion attack, yielding success rates of 82%-98%. these malicious authentication measurement results are highly pertinent in practice because, we demonstrate that the apps generally work well in the benign authentication scenario to reliably "accept" an authorized user and "reject" an unauthorized user.our work shows that many standard attacks that prior work demonstrated to be effective against standalone voice authentication algorithms do not work against current voice authentication apps. yet, our new attack designs could still compromise these apps. overall, our work highlights a serious vulnerability of real-world voice authentication apps, which seems very challenging to mitigate at a fundamental level. © 2019 ieee.},

  abstract        = {the safety of web browsers is essential to the privacy of internet users and the security of their computing systems. in the last few years, there have been several cyber attacks geared towards compromising surfers' data and systems via exploiting browser-based vulnerabilities. android and a number of mobile operating systems have been supporting a ui component called webview, which can be embedded in any mobile application to render the web contents. yet, this mini-browser component has been found to be vulnerable to various kinds of attacks. for instance, an attacker in her webview-embedded app can inject malicious javascripts into the webview to modify the web contents or to steal user's input values. this kind of attack is particularly challenging due to the full control of attackers over the content of the loaded pages. in this paper, we are proposing and testing a server-side moving target defense technique to counter the risk of javascript injection attacks on mobile webviews. the solution entails creating redundant html forms, randomizing their attributes and values, and asserting stealthy prompts for the user data. the solution does not dictate any changes to the browser or applications codes, neither it requires key sharing with benign clients. the results of our performance and security analysis suggest that our proposed approach protects the confidentiality and integrity of user input values with minimum overhead. © 2019 ieee.},

  abstract        = {the ability to repeat the execution of a program is a fundamental requirement in many areas of computing from computer system evaluation to software engineering. reproducing executions of mobile apps, in particular, has proven difficult under real-life scenarios due to multiple sources of external inputs and interactive nature of the apps. previous works that provide record/replay functionality for mobile apps are restricted to particular input sources (e.g., touchscreen events) and present deployment challenges due to intrusive modifications to the underlying software stack. moreover, due to their reliance on record and replay of device specific events, the recorded executions cannot be reliably reproduced across different platforms. in this paper, we present a new practical approach, randr, for record and replay of android applications. randr captures and replays multiple sources of input (i.e., ui and network) without requiring source code (os or app), administrative device privileges, or any special platform support. randr achieves these qualities by instrumenting a select set of methods at runtime within an application's own sandbox. in addition, to enable portability of recorded executions across different platforms for replay, randr contextualizes ui events as interactions with particular ui components (e.g., a button) as opposed to relying on platform specific features (e.g., screen coordinates). we demonstrate randr's accurate cross-platform record and replay capabilities using over 30 real-world android apps across a variety of platforms including emulators as well as commercial off-the-shelf mobile devices deployed in real life. © 2019 ieee.},

  abstract        = {the car battery in the philippines can only last for an average span of 6 to 12 months. when a battery hits the 6 months margin, it will start showing unwanted responses such as unstable start up and quick discharge. these responses must be avoided specially in times that the car is significantly needed to be in good condition, such as during an emergency or a long drive. it is an inconceivable scenario to be stuck in a place far from people. as a solution, the proponents designed a device that can automatically checked for the temperature, load current, voltage level, number of hours left before reaching critical voltage level and state of charge of a car battery via wireless technology in a real time manner using a mobile application with a dedicated storage for recording data every given period. the recording interval can be adjusted to what is desired by the user. furthermore, algorithms on statistically analyzing the recorded data is executed by the device itself which will be a helpful information on what preventive actions the user must do to improve the performance of its car battery and therefore, avoid further problems. also, the device uses a state estimation in achieving an almost zero steady state error of the parameters of the battery stated above that cannot be measured by a sensor such as the state of charge (soc) and remaining battery hours. after several testing and validation, it was found that the device where able to accurately predict the level of the parameters at a plus or minus 0.38% error. moreover, the feature of this device was made more interesting by adding a flexibility on its mean to communicate wirelessly. the system (the device and the mobile app) communicates using gsm, internet and bluetooth to increase its reliability. the user therefore has the options to manually or remotely switch loads in the vehicle. if in the event that the communication is loss, and the vehicle is approaching critical level, the device can be set to an 'auto-off' mode which automatically switch the loads off. there are instances that the loads is intended to be turned on purposively. this is why the user is given the option to enable this mode or not. most importantly, the device is tied up with a spare battery that is intended to be used for emergency jump start. thus, keeping an eye on the status of this spare battery is executed also on a regular interval. © 2019 ieee.},

  abstract      = {spotting malicious samples in the wild has always been difficult, and android malware is no exception. actually, the fact android applications are (usually) not directly accessible from market places hardens the task even more. for instance, google enforces its own communication protocol to browse and download applications from its market. thus, an efficient market crawler must reverse and implement this protocol, issue appropriate search requests and take necessary steps so as not to be banned. from end-users' side, having difficulties spotting malicious mobile applications results in most android malware remaining unnoticed up to 3 months before a security researcher finally stumbles on it. to reduce this window of opportunity, this paper presents a heuristics engine that statically pre-processes and prioritizes samples. the engine uses 39 different flags of different nature such as java api calls, presence of embedded executables, code size, urls... each flag is assigned a different weight, based on statistics we computed from the techniques mobile malware authors most commonly use in their code. the engine outputs a risk score which highlights samples which are the most likely to be malicious. the engine has been tested over a set of clean applications and malicious ones. the results show a strong difference in the average risk score for both sets and in its distribution, proving its use to spot malware. © 2012 springer-verlag france.},

  abstract        = {automatic food understanding from images is an interesting challenge with applications in different domains. in particular, food intake monitoring is becoming more and more important because of the key role that it plays in health and market economies. in this paper, we address the study of food image processing from the perspective of computer vision. as first contribution we present a survey of the studies in the context of food image processing from the early attempts to the current state-of-the-art methods. since retrieval and classification engines able to work on food images are required to build automatic systems for diet monitoring (e.g., to be embedded in wearable cameras), we focus our attention on the aspect of the representation of the food images because it plays a fundamental role in the understanding engines. the food retrieval and classification is a challenging task since the food presents high variableness and an intrinsic deformability. to properly study the peculiarities of different image representations we propose the unict-fd1200 dataset. it was composed of 4754 food images of 1200 distinct dishes acquired during real meals. each food plate is acquired multiple times and the overall dataset presents both geometric and photometric variabilities. the images of the dataset have been manually labeled considering 8 categories: appetizer, main course, second course, single course, side dish, dessert, breakfast, fruit. we have performed tests employing different representations of the state-of-the-art to assess the related performances on the unict-fd1200 dataset. finally, we propose a new representation based on the perceptual concept of anti-textons which is able to encode spatial information between textons outperforming other representations in the context of food retrieval and classification. © 2016 elsevier ltd},

  abstract        = {as mobile computing increasingly interacts with the cloud, a number of approaches, e.g., maui and clonecloud, have been proposed, aiming to offload parts of the mobile application execution to the cloud. to achieve a good performance by using these approaches, they particularly focus on the application partitioning problem, i.e., to decide which parts of an application should be offloaded to the cloud and which parts should be executed on mobile devices such that the execution cost is minimized. most works on this problem assume that the offloading cost of each part of the application remains the same as the application is running. unfortunately, this assumption does not hold in dynamic mobile cloud environments, where the device and network connection status may fluctuate, and thus affects the offloading cost. with the varying offloading cost, the one time partitioning of the application may yield significant performance degradations. in this paper, we study application repartitioning problem which considers updating the partition periodically during the course of application execution. we first propose a framework for run time application repartitioning in dynamic mobile cloud environments. based on this framework, we take the dynamic network connection to clouds as a case study, and design an online solution, foreseer, to solve the mobile cloud application repartitioning problem. we evaluate our solution based on real world data traces that are collected in a campus wifi hotspot testbed. the result shows that our method can achieve significantly shorter completion time over previous approaches. © 2013 ieee.},

  abstract        = {during the rapid development cycle for internet products (websites and mobile apps), new features are developed and rolled out to users constantly. features with code defects or design flaws can cause outages and significant degradation of user experience. the traditional method of code review and change management can be time-consuming and error-prone. in order to make the feature rollout process safe and fast, this paper proposes a methodology for rolling out features in an automated way using an adaptive experimental design. under this framework, a feature is gradually ramped up from a small proportion of users to a larger population based on real-time evaluation of the performance of important metrics. if there are any regression detected during the ramp-up step, the ramp-up process stops and the feature developer is alerted. there are two main algorithm components powering this framework: 1) a continuous monitoring algorithm - using a variant of the sequential probability ratio test (sprt) to monitor the feature performance metrics and alert feature developers when a metric degradation is detected, 2) an automated ramp-up algorithm - deciding when and how to ramp up to the next stage with larger sample size. this paper presents one monitoring algorithm and three ramping up algorithms including time-based, power-based, and risk-based (a bayesian approach) schedules. these algorithms are evaluated and compared on both simulated data and real data. there are three benefits provided by this framework for feature rollout: 1) for defective features, it can detect the regression early and reduce negative effect, 2) for healthy features, it rolls out the feature quickly, 3) it reduces the need for manual intervention via the automation of the feature rollout process. © 2018 ieee.},

  abstract        = {automated teller machine (atm) security system currently still uses magnetic cards and static pin as its security system, which create many security holes. this security hole in many cases caused many bank customers to lose money mysteriously. in this paper a two-factor authentication system which uses atm card and dynamic pin is proposed to overcome this security hole. in this paper, a prototype of an atm and m-banking application were built. the atm prototype uses several components such as the raspberry pi 3b, smart card, smart card reader / writer, keypad number and lcd monitor. dynamic pins are generated using the csprng-sha1-mwc random number generator. in developing the prototypes, the framework used in this study is based on mobile applications and cloud computing. to evaluate the quality of the prototype, we performed qualitative and quantitative tests. qualitatively we tested the prototype using a questionnaire using 165 sample respondents to provide an opinion about the safety and comfort of our prototype and quantitatively we measured the prototype to find out the level of randomness of the generated pin and the qos of the designed prototype. © 2019 ieee.},

  abstract        = {parking could become a nightmare on a busy day, in a city like delhi (india), which has about 7.35 million cars, as per morth barclays research (2012). an average of seventeen minutes and considerable amount of fuel is wasted in an effort to find a parking spot every time. additional stress is induced due to parking hassles starting from finding an empty parking spot to relocating the car later. we propose a system leveraging the latest technologies that will help motorists overcome their parking problems and at the same time, make managing a parking space easier and cost effective by automating the entire process right from pre-booking a parking slot to making the payment. since most of the parking spaces are equipped with cctv surveillance cameras, we intend to use them to detect the presence of cars and measure the availability of parking spots within a parking space using techniques like image processing and machine learning. in order to test the performance of the proposed system, a prototype of the system is built that mimics the working of an actual parking space excluding minute details. a prototype of the application is built that would aid the user in booking the slot and guide him/her back to the allocated parking slot. the proposed system is compared with the existing systems and the results show superiority of the proposed system in terms of parameters like reliability, scalability and installation cost. © 2017 ieee.},

  abstract        = {interest in mobile applications (mobile apps) has grown significantly in recent years and has become an important part of the software development market. indeed, mobile apps become more and more complex and evolve constantly, while their development time decreases. this complexity and time pressure might lead developers to adopt bad design and implementation choices, which are known as code smells. code smells in mobile apps could lead to performance issues such as overconsumption of hardware resources (cpu, ram, battery) or even downtime and crashes. some tools have been proposed for the detection of code smells in android apps, such as paprika or adoctor tools. these tools rely on metrics-based detection rules, which are defined manually according to code smell definitions. however, manually defined rules might be inaccurate and subjective because they are based on user interpretations. in this paper, we present a tool-based approach, called fakie, which allows the automatic inference of detection rules by analysing code smells data using an association rules algorithm: fpgrowth. we validated fakie by applying it on a manually analysed validation dataset of 48 opensource mobile apps. we were able to generate detection rules for a dozen code smells, with an average f-measure of 0.95. after all of that, we performed an empirical study by applying fakie on 2,993 apps downloaded from androzoo, a repository of mobile apps. © 2019 ieee.},

  note            = {cited by 0},
  abstract        = {crypto phones are emerging apps aimed for end-to-end secure communications. to detect man-in-the-middle (mitm) attacks, traditional crypto phones rely upon end-users to verbally exchange and compare a short protocol fingerprint. this requirement is often found to be inconvenient by the users. hence, most current apps do not mandate fingerprint validation, allowing the users to opt-out, completely disregarding security in favor of usability. besides, speaking the fingerprints is not free of user errors, which may lead to rejection of benign sessions degrading the user experience. in this paper, we address these fundamental problems by introducing stethoscope1, a new crypto phone model that removes the human user from the loop of fingerprint comparison by using text-to-speech and speech-to-text transformations. stethoscope automatically performs two tasks on behalf of the user: (1) creating the fingerprint by incorporating a fingerprint speaking tool at the sender side, built on top of a limited-domain text-to-speech engine, and (2) decoding/comparing the fingerprint at the receiver side based on a robust speech-to-text engine. like the traditional design, stethoscope relies on the receiver to manually verify the sender's voice to detect sophisticated voice attacks. on the sender side, we design an automated fingerprint speaking tool based on a limited-domain text-to-speech system using reordering of words in a phonetically-distinct word dictionary previously spoken by the user. this tool asks the users to speak all the words in the fingerprint dictionary only once to train the system. on the receiver side, to decode the fingerprint, we design a robust speech-to-text transcription method. we evaluate the effect of automating the fingerprint creation, transfer, and comparison in the stethoscope design against manual speaker verification with a user study. our results show that stethoscope provides a 0% false accept and 0% false reject rate for the fingerprint comparison, while offering a higher level of speaker verification performance compared to traditional crypto phones. © 2019 ieee.},

  abstract        = {human space flight is a prototypical example of a complex, dynamic, and safety-critical domain in which missions are performed by collaborative teams of humans and technical systems. in such domains, intelligent electronic partners (epartners) can play a useful role in supporting human-robot teams in their problem solving process whenever a non-nominal situation is encountered. to enhance the supportive capabilities of such epartners, this paper presents an approach to formally represent the functionality of human-robot teams in terms of different levels of abstraction. by establishing formal relations between domain knowledge at different abstraction levels and introducing reasoning rules to navigate through these relations, epartners are endowed with a number of supportive functions, such as the ability to reason about the mission status, make suggestions in non-nominal situations, and provide explanations. the approach is applied to a use case in the context of a manned space mission to mars. it has been implemented within a mobile application to assist robotastronaut teams during space missions, and has been tested in a pilot experiment at the european space research and technology centre. © springer international publishing switzerland 2015.},

  abstract        = {wireless distributed computing (wdc) is an enabling technology that allows radio nodes to cooperate in processing complex computational tasks of an application in a distributed manner. wdc research is being driven by the fact that mobile portable computing devices have limitations in executing complex mobile applications, mainly attributed to their limited resource and functionality. this article focuses on resource allocation in wdc networks, specifically on scheduling and task allocation. in wdc, it is important to schedule communications between the nodes in addition to the allocation of computational tasks to nodes. communication scheduling and heterogeneity in the operating environment make the wdc resource allocation problem challenging to address. this article presents a task allocation and scheduling algorithm that optimizes both energy consumption and makespan in a heuristic manner. the proposed algorithm uses a comprehensive model of the energy consumption for the execution of tasks and communication between tasks assigned to different radio nodes. the algorithm is tested for three objectives, namely, minimization of makespan, minimization of energy consumption, and minimization of both makespan and energy consumption. © 2011 springer science+business media, llc.},

  year          = {2008},
  note          = {cited by 1},
  abstract      = {the use of microelectronic components in mobile appliances is constantly increasing. appliances like mobile phones, pda's and navigation systems contain more and more functionality and smaller microelectronic components. dropping an appliance during its lifespan is very common and the product is required to survive this. the drop however generates significant forces and vibrations on the internal assembly of the product. the performance of a microelectronic component under drop conditions has thus become an important reliability parameter. assessing the solder interconnect quality by means of drop impact testing, as standardized by e.g. jedec, during normal production requires considerable amounts of time and effort. besides this, the repeatability of the drop impact test is low and introduces elaborate and time-consuming analysis of the results after testing. already many researchers have investigated new test techniques capable of replacing the drop impact test, e.g. high-speed shear [1], pull [2] and bending. among those tests is the high speed cold bump pull test (hscbp or cbp). in the cbp test the solder bump is pulled in vertical direction from the die using a small pair of jaws. in this test, by varying the pull speed several different strain-rates can be applied to the solder bump. in our research a correlation between the drop impact test and cold bump pull test is investigated. this can be divided into three parts. first by investigating the cold bump pull test apparatus for uncontrolled parameters that might introduce a bias or spread in the results. secondly by means of modeling the cold bump pull test to investigate solder bump deformation and solder bump loading during pull off. finally in a comparison the differences and similarities between the two tests are briefly discussed and some observations concerning the solder joint performance are presented. the correlation between the two tests is focused on a method capable of translating the loading conditions experienced in the drop impact test towards a cold bump pull test prescription. several numerical simulations have been used to investigate the solder ball during deformation and destruction. the cold bump pull experiments are used to rule out as much variances as possible and improvements for the cold bump pull apparatus are proposed. ©2008 ieee.},

  abstract        = {layout bugs commonly exist in mobile apps. due to the fragmentation issues of smartphones, a layout bug may occur only on particular versions of smartphones. it is quite challenging to detect such bugs for state-of-the-art commercial automated testing platforms, although they can test an app with thousands of different smartphones in parallel. the main reason is that typical layout bugs neither crash an app nor generate any error messages. in this paper, we present our work for detecting text-layout bugs, which account for a large portion of layout bugs. we model text-layout bug detection as a classification problem. this then allows us to address it with sophisticated image processing and machine learning techniques. to this end, we propose an approach which we call textout. textout takes screenshots as its input and adopts a specifically-tailored text detection method and a convolutional neural network (cnn) classifier to perform automatic text-layout bug detection. we collect 33,102 text-region images as our training dataset and verify the effectiveness of our tool with 1,481 text-region images collected from real-world apps. textout achieves an auc (area under the curve) of 0.956 on the test dataset and shows an acceptable overhead. the dataset is open-source released for follow-up research. © 2019 ieee.},

  abstract        = {mhealth is a pervasive and ubiquitous technology which has revolutionized the healthcare system for both health providers and patients (wang et al. 2016). each year, globally, about 15 million babies are born too soon (premature) or too small (low birthweight small for gestational age); among these 2.7 million newborns die every year due to complications from prematurity (every new born 2014). common complications of prematurity like feeding problems, and hypothermia lead to high rates of morbidity and mortality among prematurely born babies each year. delivery of evidence-based essential newborn care interventions, from birth through the first 24 h of postnatal life, has been shown to improve health and well-being, and reduce mortality, among newborns. however, due to a variety of barriers, bottlenecks, and challenges, many babies born in resource-limited settings do not receive the full complement of these lifesaving interventions. in order to address these challenges, the american academy of pediatrics (aap) has developed an integrated educational and training curriculm for health care providers and family stakeholders in lmics called essential care for every baby (eceb). eceb has an action plan, which serves as a decision support tool and job aid for health care providers. (figure 1), by synthesizing research over a decade on helping babies survive (essential care for every baby 2018). this program teaches health care providers essential newborn care practices to keep all babies healthy from the time of birth to discharge from the facility. yet, the nuances of monitoring, tracking and taking care of multiple babies simultaneously in neonatal wards has a big cognitive load on nurses, who must perform tasks every few minutes on each baby. the care is divided into three phases based on the time after birth: phase 1 (0–60 min), phase 2 (60–90 min), phase 3 (90 min-24 h). we iteratively developed and tested the usability of the eceb action plan, as part of the mobile helping babies survive (mhbs) suite of apps, and plan to field test the app in the near future. fig. 1. © 2019, springer nature switzerland ag.},

  abstract      = {the cloud seems to be an excellent companion of mobile systems, to alleviate battery consumption on smartphones and to backup user's data on-the-fly. indeed, many recent works focus on frameworks that enable mobile computation offloading to software clones of smartphones on the cloud and on designing cloud-based backup systems for the data stored in our devices. both mobile computation offloading and data backup involve communication between the real devices and the cloud. this communication does certainly not come for free. it costs in terms of bandwidth (the traffic overhead to communicate with the cloud) and in terms of energy (computation and use of network interfaces on the device). in this work we study the feasibility of both mobile computation offloading and mobile software/data backups in real-life scenarios. in our study we assume an architecture where each real device is associated to a software clone on the cloud. we consider two types of clones: the off-clone, whose purpose is to support computation offloading, and the back-clone, which comes to use when a restore of user's data and apps is needed. we give a precise evaluation of the feasibility and costs of both off-clones and back-clones in terms of bandwidth and energy consumption on the real device. we achieve this through measurements done on a real testbed of 11 android smartphones and an equal number of software clones running on the amazon ec2 public cloud. the smartphones have been used as the primary mobile by the participants for the whole experiment duration. © 2013 ieee.},

  abstract        = {phishing attacks have been increasing recently. attackers use clever social engineering techniques to convince their victims into clicking a malware or deceptive login-based webpages. most solutions for this particular problem focus more on helping desktop computer users than mobile device users. mobile device users are more vulnerable than their desktop counterparts because they are online most of the time and they have device limitations such as smaller screen size and low computational power. this paper presents unphishme, an effective mobile application prototype that takes advantage of a particular weakness of phishing sites: they accept any kind of input information for authentication. unphishme enables a mobile device user to create fake login account, with fake login credentials, that mimics user login procedure every time the user opens a login webpage and generates an alert to her. unphishme determines whether the current login page shifts to another webpage after an authentication attempt. it does so by monitoring hashcode changes of the url when the page is loading, listens to httpurlconnection status code, and then makes a decision on whether the website is fraudulent or not. we measured the effectiveness of unphishme by conducting a user experiment on android platforms and tested its detection accuracy, memory and cpu performance. the results show that unphishme uses a very small amount of computational power and it is effective in assisting users to identify phishing attacks with an accuracy of 96%. © 2017 ieee.},

  abstract        = {public transportation becomes increasingly diverse because of innovation in transport modalities and a large number of service providers. for facilitating passengers' comfort, intermodal passenger information systems are required, which combine data of different providers and transport modes. therefore, context sensitive mobile applications are promising solutions to supporting passengers at every stage of their trip. crucial for the success of these applications is their usability. in this paper, a prototype of an intermodal passenger information system is investigated in a usability evaluation and tested in comparison to the leading mobility application in germany. both ios apps were evaluated with a questionnaire using the system usability scale (sus) in a lab setting (n=20) and in a field test (n=20). additionally, participants of the field test were interviewed retrospectively about app and setting. the user feedback was beneficial in learning about users' expectations towards information retrieval procedure in and functionalities of a passenger information system. the usability evaluation basically revealed easy to improve usability problems, but also a trust issue and the need for a participatory component in public transportation, probably by integrating social media. © 2014 springer international publishing switzerland.},

  abstract        = {in the current generation of information technology, mobile applications (apps) have become an essential and momentous source to publicize the information across the world. academia, industries and other organizations have preferred mobile apps rather than classical software. mobile apps are different from classical software and popularity, adaptability of mobile apps is more with wide range use. the growth of mobile apps across various fields has shown a big challenge for mobile app development industries to deliver apps on time and budget with desired accuracy and performance. planning of mobile-based projects is a very complex task for the software industry, especially estimation of effort, time and cost for development of mobile apps. there are various literature, method, and model available in the field of classical software but mobile apps are different from classical software by their nature. it has also observed that the selection of input data is also affecting the accuracy of prediction. there is lack of calibrated model and method that administer the immense scope of determination in development of effort estimation for mobile apps. in this paper, various existing techniques of effort estimation have applied on software analytics for mobile apps (samoa) dataset for better analysis of suitable estimation technique that fits for mobile app development. the aim of this paper is twofold—(i) to explore the performance of variously established estimation technique on mobile app development (samoa dataset). (ii) analysis of experimental results and, suggesting the best technique for the distinguished mobile app development scenario. the work is carried out adopting four techniques namely multiple linear regressions, multi-layer perceptron neural network (mlp-nn), genetic algorithm (ga) and naïve forecasting approach. the results have compared with these statistical models. among all techniques, the experimental results have presented that the ga was outperforming among four effort estimation techniques. mobile app effort estimation models have built using four-estimation technique using samoa dataset. in addition, we investigated and compared various techniques namely mlp, mlp-nn, ga and naïve forecasting approach. upon construction, accuracy measures mmre, mre, pred(25) represented promising outcomes for mobile apps used in the effort estimation model construction and validation of the process. the analysis presented that ga provided better performance rather than another approach. © 2019, springer science+business media, llc, part of springer nature.},

  abstract        = {background: the compatibilities between donors and recipients are extremely important for evaluating the immunological risks of transplants. one challenge faced by data analysis tools is the transformation of complex data into simple, intuitive, and important information that can be used to resolve contemporary problems. to address this challenge, we developed the epvix software to perform epitope reactivity analyses and automated epitope virtual crossmatching. epvix is a facilitator of medical decision-making regarding the identification of the best donor for a high-immunologic risk recipient. the objective of this work is to describe the computational architecture of the epvix ecosystem (http://www.epvix.com.br). materials and methods: epvix is a freeware on the web that was developed in the ruby language. epvix can be accessed from different platforms, e.g., pcs, tablets, and smartphones. it consists of an ecosystem of tools that are capable of integrating all of the stakeholders who are involved in a transplant process with a deceased donor. results: we successfully developed a program that allows people to work collaboratively and effectively during the donation process by accurately predicting negative crossmatches, saving time and other resources. conclusions: epvix represents a significant breakthrough for the organ transplant process and may meet the current needs of transplant programs because it increases the chances of the allocation of low-immunologic risk donors to highly sensitized recipients and assures greater equity among the recipients on a waiting list. epvix was duly verified and tested in terms of data security. moreover, usability tests demonstrated that epvix is an intuitive and easy-to-use tool. © 2016 elsevier ltd.},

  abstract             = {{existing mobile platforms are based on manual way of granting and
   revoking permissions to applications. once the user grants a given
   permission to an application, the application can use it without limit,
   unless the user manually revokes the permission. this has become the
   reason for many privacy problems because of the fact that a permission
   that is harmless at some occasion may be very dangerous at another
   condition. one of the promising solutions for this problem is
   context-aware access control at permission level that allows dynamic
   granting and denying of permissions based on some predefined context.
   however, dealing with policy configuration at permission level becomes
   very complex for the user as the number of policies to configure will
   become very large. for instance, if there are a applications, p
   permissions, and c contexts, the user may have to deal with axpxc number
   of policy configurations. therefore, we propose a context-aware
   role-based access control model that can provide dynamic permission
   granting and revoking while keeping the number of policies as small as
   possible. although our model can be used for all mobile platforms, we
   use android platform to demonstrate our system. in our model, android
   applications are assigned roles where roles contain a set of permissions
   and contexts are associated with permissions. permissions are activated
   and deactivated for the containing role based on the associated
   contexts. our approach is unique in that our system associates contexts
   with permissions as opposed to existing similar works that associate
   contexts with roles. as a proof of concept, we have developed a
   prototype application called context-aware android role-based access
   control. we have also performed various tests using our application, and
   the result shows that our model is working as desired. (c) 2017 john

  abstract       = {{indoor positioning systems (ips) have been recently adopted by many
   researchers for their broad applications in various internet of things
   (iot) fields such as logistics, health, construction industries, and
   security. received signal strength (rss)-based fingerprinting approaches
   have been widely used for positioning inside buildings because they have
   a distinct advantage of low cost over other indoor positioning
   techniques. the signal power rss is a function of the distance between
   the mobile system (ms) and access point (ap), which varies due to the
   multipath propagation phenomenon and human body blockage. furthermore,
   fingerprinting approaches have several disadvantages such as labor cost,
   diversity (in signals and environment), and computational cost.
   eliminating redundancy by ruling out non-informative aps not only
   reduces the computation time, but also improves the performance of ips.
   in this article, we propose a dimensionality reduction technique in a
   multiple service set identifier-based indoor positioning system with
   multiple service set identifiers (mssids), which means that each ap can
   be configured to transmit n signals instead of one signal, to serve
   different kinds of clients simultaneously. therefore, we investigated
   various kinds of approaches for the selection of informative aps such as
   spatial variance, strongest aps, and random selection. these approaches
   were tested using two clustering techniques including k-means and fuzzy
   c-means. performance evaluation was focused on two elements, the number
   of informative aps versus the accuracy of the proposed system. to assess
   the proposed system, real data was acquired from within the college of
   engineering and applied sciences (ceas) at the western michigan
   university (wmu) building. the results exhibit the superiority of fused
   multiple service set identifiers (mssid) performance over the single
   ssid. moreover, the results report that the proposed system achieves a
   positioning accuracy <0.85 m over 3000 m(2), with an accumulative
   density function (cdf) of 88\% with a distance error of 2 m.}},

  abstract             = {{background: performance tests are important to characterize patient
   disabilities and functional changes. the osteoarthritis research society
   international and others recommend the 30-second chair stand test and
   stair climb test, among others, as core tests that capture two distinct
   types of disability during activities of daily living. however, these
   two tests are limited by current protocols of testing in clinics. there
   is a need for an alternative that allows remote testing of functional
   capabilities during these tests in the osteoarthritis patient
   population.
   objective: objectives are to (1) develop an app for testing the
   functionality of an iphone's accelerometer and gravity sensor and (2)
   conduct a pilot study objectively evaluating the criterion validity and
   test-retest reliability of outcome variables obtained from these sensors
   during the 30-second chair stand test and stair climb test.
   methods: an ios app was developed with data collection capabilities from
   the built-in iphone accelerometer and gravity sensor tools and linked to
   google firebase. a total of 24 subjects performed the 30-second chair
   stand test with an iphone accelerometer collecting data and an external
   rater manually counting sit-to-stand repetitions. a total of 21 subjects
   performed the stair climb test with an iphone gravity sensor turned on
   and an external rater timing the duration of the test on a stopwatch.
   app data from firebase were converted into graphical data and exported
   into matlab for data filtering. multiple iterations of a data processing
   algorithm were used to increase robustness and accuracy.
   matlab-generated outcome variables were compared to the manually
   determined outcome variables of each test. pearson's correlation
   coefficients (pccs), bland-altman plots, intraclass correlation
   coefficients (iccs), standard errors of measurement, and repeatability
   coefficients were generated to evaluate criterion validity, agreement,
   and test-retest reliability of iphone sensor data against gold-standard
   manual measurements.
   results: app accelerometer data during the 30-second chair stand test
   (pcc=.890) and gravity sensor data during the stair climb test
   (pcc=.865) were highly correlated to gold-standard manual measurements.
   greater than 95\% of values on bland-altman plots comparing the manual
   data to the app data fell within the 95\% limits of agreement. strong
   intraclass correlation was found for trials of the 30-second chair stand
   test (icc=.968) and stair climb test (icc=.902). standard errors of
   measurement for both tests were found to be within acceptable thresholds
   for matlab. repeatability coefficients for the 30-second chair stand
   test and stair climb test were 0.629 and 1.20, respectively.
   conclusions: app-based performance testing of the 30-second chair stand
   test and stair climb test is valid and reliable, suggesting its
   applicability to future, larger-scale studies in the osteoarthritis
   patient population.}},

  abstract       = {{supervisory control and data acquisition (scada) is a technology for
   monitoring and controlling distributed processes. scada provides
   real-time data exchange between a control/monitoring centre and field
   devices connected to the distributed processes. a scada system performs
   these functions using its four basic elements: field instrumentation
   devices (fids) such as sensors and actuators which are connected to the
   distributed process plants being managed, remote terminal units (rtus)
   such as single board computers for receiving, processing and sending the
   remote data from the field instrumentation devices, master terminal
   units (mtus) for handling data processing and human machine
   interactions, and lastly scada communication channels for connecting the
   rtus to the mtus, and for parsing the acquired data. generally, there
   are two classes of scada hardware and software; proprietary (commercial)
   and open source. in this paper, we present the design and implementation
   of a low-cost, open source scada system by using thinger.io local server
   iot platform as the mtu and esp32 thing micro-controller as the rtu.
   scada architectures have evolved over the years from monolithic
   (stand-alone) through distributed and networked architectures to the
   latest internet of things (iot) architecture. the scada system proposed
   in this work is based on the internet of things scada architecture which
   incorporates web services with the conventional (traditional) scada for
   a more robust supervisory control and monitoring. it comprises of analog
   current and voltage sensors, the low-power esp32 thing micro-controller,
   a raspberry pi micro-controller, and a local wi-fi router. in its
   implementation, the current and voltage sensors acquire the desired data
   from the process plant, the esp32 micro-controller receives, processes
   and sends the acquired sensor data via a wi-fi network to the thinger.io
   local server iot platform for data storage, real-time monitoring and
   remote control. the thinger.io server is locally hosted by the raspberry
   pi micro-controller, while the wi-fi network which forms the scada
   communication channel is created using the wi-fi router. in order to
   test the proposed scada system solution, the designed hardware was set
   up to remotely monitor the photovoltaic (pv) voltage, current, and
   power, as well as the storage battery voltage of a 260 w, 12 v solar pv
   system. some of the created human machine interfaces (hmis) on
   thinger.io server where an operator can remotely monitor the data in the
   cloud, as well as initiate supervisory control activities if the
   acquired data are not in the expected range, using both a computer
   connected to the network, and thinger.io mobile apps are presented in
   the paper.}},

   due to the advent of internet of things, in the near future a cloud of a

   deployed wireless networks in this kind of environment is mandatory and
   obtaining accurate radio propagation estimations by means of a

   in-house three-dimensional ray launching algorithm is employed, which
   provides radio frequency power distribution values, power delay
   profiles, and delay spread values for the complete volume of complex
   indoor scenarios. using this information together with signal-to-noise

   to clinical settings. however, we are spending increasing amounts of
   time interacting with devices that present high-resolution, full color
   images and video (hereafter, digital media) and can record our
   responses. most of these devices can be used to measure visual acuity
   and other aspects of visual function, not just with targeted testing
   experiences but from typical device interactions. there is growing
   evidence that prolonged exposure to digital media can lead to various
   vision-related issues (eg, computer vision syndrome, dry eye, etc.). our
   regular, daily interactions (digital behavior) can also be used to
   assess our visual function, passively and continuously. this allows us
   to expand vision health assessment beyond the clinic, to collect
   vision-related data in the whole range of settings for typical digital
   behavior from practically any population(s) of interest and to further
   explore just how our increasingly virtual interactions are affecting our
   vision. we present a tool that can be easily integrated into digital
   media to provide insights into our digital behavior.}},

   with consumer-facing health apps and their consequences.
   materials and methods: we searched bibliographic databases including
   pubmed, web of science, scopus, and cochrane libraries from january 2013
   to may 2019 for articles about health apps. descriptive information
   about safety concerns and consequences were extracted and classified
   into natural categories. the review was conducted in accordance with the
   prisma-scr (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and
   meta-analyses extension for scoping reviews) statement.
   results: of the 74 studies identified, the majority were reviews of a
   single or a group of similar apps (n=66, 89\%), nearly half related to
   disease management (n=34, 46\%). a total of 80 safety concerns were
   identified, 67 related to the quality of information presented including
   incorrect or incomplete information, variation in content, and incorrect
   or inappropriate response to consumer needs. the remaining 13 related to
   app functionality including gaps in features, lack of validation for
   user input, delayed processing, failure to respond to health dangers,
   and faulty alarms. of the 52 reports of actual or potential
   consequences, 5 had potential for patient harm. we also identified 66
   reports about gaps in app development, including the lack of expert
   involvement, poor evidence base, and poor validation.
   conclusions: safety of apps is an emerging public health issue. the
   available evidence shows that apps pose clinical risks to consumers.
   involvement of consumers, regulators, and healthcare professionals in
   development and testing can improve quality. additionally, mandatory
   reporting of safety concerns is needed to improve outcomes.}},

   application.
   methods: during the 50 min of each endocrine physiology lecture,
   traditional teaching took 40 min, whereas the last 10 min were reserved
   for socrative. following the lecture, students completed small
   socrative-based quizzes on their smartphones. at the end of the module,
   students and teachers were asked for feedback and the students' test
   performances were evaluated. data were examined by the spss version 20
   for frequencies and gender/academic performance comparison.
   results: as many as 87\% of the students responded positively to
   socrative; 85\% felt that the activity was fun, 84\% were more actively
   engaged, and 71\% felt more motivated. furthermore, 90\% of the students
   agreed that this exercise enhanced their learning. most students agreed
   that socrative helped them enhance peer-to-peer and class discussions.
   students' attitudes towards socrative activity did not vary with respect
   to their gender or total screen time per day. approximately 99\% of the
   students preferred multiple-choice questions to true/false and short
   answers. instructors perceived socrative as an easy-to-use tool to
   generate discussions and assess the degree of understanding of their
   students. socrative significantly enhanced exam performance.
   conclusion: course instructors are encouraged to incorporate
   mobile-based applications in their lectures, which may make students'

   cloud services via offloading, and has numerous advantages and increased

   become more complex and expensive due to several parameters, such as the

   numerous studies have been published in the mcc domain, whereas few

   however, current studies do not address mcc and penetration testing.
   therefore, revisiting mcc and penetration testing domains is essential
   to overcoming the inherent complexity and reducing costs. motivated by
   the importance of revisiting these domains, this paper pursues two
   objectives: to provide a comprehensive systematic literature review
   (slr) of the mcc, security and penetration testing domains and to
   establish the requirements for penetration testing of mcc applications.
   this paper has systematically reviewed previous penetration testing
   models and techniques based on the requirements in kitchenham's slr
   guidelines. the slr outcome has indicated the following deficiencies:
   the offloading parameter is disregarded; studies that address mobile,
   cloud, and web vulnerabilities are lacking; and a mcc application
   penetration testing model has not been addressed by current studies. in
   particular, offloading and mobile state management are two new and vital
   requirements that have not been addressed to reveal hidden security

   objective of this paper is to construct highly secure indoor areas

   in this paper, we present a fine-grained location-based authentication
   system (locauth) which ensures the physical presence of the user within
   his/her small trusted zone (2 m(2) area). to do this, locauth exploits
   the ambient wireless network characteristics (e.g., bssid, ssid, and
   rssi) of nearby wi-fi and bluetooth devices observed from each trusted
   zone. we propose a novel technique called top-ranked network nodes
   (trnns) to accurately overcome the fluctuations in wireless signals and
   enhance the ability to distinguish targeted trusted zone from
   neighboring areas. in addition, we developed an application to implement
   locauth on android-based smartphones and tested it in a real indoor
   environment. the tested area is composed of seven adjacent and closely
   spaced work cubicles located in our lab. we evaluated locauth in two
   ways: through rssi-based nearest neighbors (rssi-based nn) and through
   supervised machine learning algorithm (support vector machines). the
   results of the experiment show the effectiveness of locauth by achieving
   a high classification accuracy (above 98\%). this demonstrates its

   market as hybrid platforms are providing a promising development choice.
   this approach ``wraps{''} standard web code (html, javascript, and css)
   into a thin native layer, enabling the same code base to run on several
   platforms. this approach also provides a mechanism to access device
   native sensors, such as camera and geolocation, through javascript code.
   apache cordova is an open source library that is a common component in
   many hybrid platforms, such as phonegap and ibm worklight. yet, its
   configuration model suffers several security limitations including a
   coarse-grained access control model, risky defaults, and for many
   developers, a non-trivial configuration process. hybrid app development
   is an intricate task as is, not to mention configuring these apps
   securely. given the increased popularity of the approach itself and the
   proven tendency of developers to use platform-provided default settings,
   this paper presents a novel approach to automatically generate
   configurations that are more aligned to the app requirements, more
   granular, and more conformant with least privilege principle. we argue
   that having aligned configurations forms the first line of defense
   against attacks similar to injection attacks. such attacks could have
   been voided if the app configurations were more granular and tailored.
   our approach generates initial configuration settings based on modeling
   app behavior. the model generates twofold policies, one centered around
   apis access and another around controlling app states transition. we
   have successfully instrumented cordova library to implement our
   approach. we have tested the instrumented version, and our experiments
   demonstrate that the instrumented version is a practical and performant

  abstract             = {{background: by 2022, it is estimated that the rate of female obesity
   (78\%) in saudi arabia will almost double that of males (41\%). despite
   being mainly attributed to poor diet, sedentary lifestyle, and a lack of
   health awareness, behavioral modification interventions are relatively
   new to the population; bariatric surgery continues to be the treatment
   of choice for comorbidities. however, neither pre nor postoperative diet
   and exercise are promoted. evidence-informed mobile health (mhealth)
   weight loss apps and interventions may be an effective tool for
   delivering a culturally relevant intervention.
   objective: this study aimed to determine the feasibility of a weight
   loss intervention that tests the effectiveness of twazon, an originally
   designed arabic weight-loss app that promotes lifestyle modification
   specific to arab populations.
   methods: a pre-post single-arm pilot study was carried out among a
   sample of 240 overweight volunteer saudi women residing in riyadh, saudi
   arabia who used the twazon app over a 4-month period. anthropometric,
   diet, and physical activity measures were assessed 3 times: baseline,
   2-months and 4-months; frequency of app use and system usability were
   evaluated during the 2 latter data collection periods. repeated measures
   analysis of variance was used to identify changes over time.
   results: a total of 40 participants completed the 4-month intervention
   with an attrition rate of 83\%. an evaluation of the frequency of app
   use fostered 2 groups: engaged users (65\%) and unengaged users (35\%).
   at 4 months, the engaged users experienced more successful outcomes;
   body weight was lowered on average by 1.3 (sd 0.6) kg (p=.18), waist
   circumference (wc) was reduced by 4.9 (sd 1.1) cm (p<.001), and daily
   energy consumption was decreased by >600 calories (p=.002). unengaged
   users experienced minor changes in body weight, wc, and reduced energy
   intake.
   conclusions: the findings have demonstrated that engagement with the
   twazon app renders positive changes in body weight, wc, and energy
   intake. mhealth weight loss apps and interventions have the potential to
   be effective in promoting weight loss and healthy lifestyle modification
   in saudi arabia and similar populations.}},

  abstract          = {{this paper presents an innovative design solution for a compact
   electro-hydraulic actuator (eha). although the current trend in many
   mobile applications is towards electro mechanical solutions (emas)
   instead of hydraulic actuation systems (has), the use of heas could
   represent the best technological compromise. in fact, eha can combine
   the power to weight ratio advantage of hydraulic technology with the
   versatility and ease of control of electric technology. compared to
   emas, which are often equipped with low efficiency load holding
   mechanisms, ehas can also offer superior energy efficiency.
   the key element of the compact eha system taken as reference in this
   study is a miniaturized bi-directional gear pump (from 0.13 cc/rev). the
   pump design is conceived to maximize performance in terms of efficiency,
   noise emissions and durability. in particular, a novel pressure
   compensation system was formulated to minimize power losses associated
   with the internal lubricating gaps in the whole field of operation. in
   the considered eha system, the pump is used to control a differential
   cylinder in a layout that includes built-in valves to allow control of
   the actuator according to a power-on-demand strategy. applications of
   the proposed eha includes aircrafts, cargo and vehicle doors, hatches
   and landing gears.
   the paper describes the numerical approach used to formulate the new
   design for gear pump used in the reference eha. in particular, an
   optimization procedure based on the use of a detailed simulation model
   for pressure compensated external gear unit was formulated. based on the
   optimal design provided by the optimization procedure, a prototype was
   realized and tested. experimental results confirmed the potentials of
   the proposed design procedure.}},

   lives. however, such services require continuous user tracking while
   preserving the scarce cell-phone battery resource. in this article, we
   present dejavu, a system that uses standard cell-phone sensors to
   provide accurate and energy-efficient outdoor localization. dejavu is
   capable of localizing and navigating both pedestrian and in-vehicle
   users in real time. our analysis shows that, whether walking or
   in-vehicle, when the user encounters a road landmark such as going
   inside a tunnel, ascending a staircase, or even moving over a bump, all
   these different landmarks affect the inertial sensors on the phone in a
   unique pattern. dejavu employs a dead-reckoning localization approach
   and leverages these road landmarks, among other automatically discovered
   virtual landmarks, to reset the dead-reckoning accumulated error and
   achieve accurate localization. to maintain a lowenergy profile, dejavu
   uses only energy-efficient sensors or sensors that are already running
   for other purposes. moreover, dejavu provides a localization confidence
   measure along with its predicted location. this improves the usability
   of the predicted location from end users' perspective.
   we present the design of dejavu and how it leverages crowd-sourcing to
   automatically learn virtual landmarks and their locations. our
   evaluation results from implementation on different android devices
   using different testbeds showing that dejavu can localize cell-phones in
   vehicles with a median error of 8.4m in city roads and 16.6m on highways
   and can localize cell-phones carried by pedestrians with a median error
   of 3.0m. moreover, compared to the global position system (gps) and
   other state-of-the-art systems, dejavu can extend the battery lifetime
   by up to 347\%, while achieving even better localization results than
   gps in the more challenging in-city areas. in addition, dejavu estimates
   the localization confidence measure accurately with a median error of
   2.3m and 31cm for in-vehicle and pedestrian users, respectively.}},

  abstract             = {{the security of mobile applications has become a major research field
   which is associated with a lot of challenges. the high rate of
   developing mobile applications has resulted in less secure applications.
   this is due to what is called the ``rush to release{''} as defined by
   ponemon institute. security testing-which is considered one of the main
   phases of the development life cycle-is either not performed or given
   minimal time; hence, there is a need for security testing automation.
   one of the techniques used is automated vulnerability detection.
   vulnerability detection is one of the security tests that aims at
   pinpointing potential security leaks. fixing those leaks results in
   protecting smart-phones and tablet mobile device users against attacks.
   this paper focuses on building a hybrid approach of static and dynamic
   analysis for detecting the vulnerabilities of android applications. this
   approach is capsuled in a usable platform (web application) to make it
   easy to use for both public users and professional developers. static
   analysis, on one hand, performs code analysis. it does not require
   running the application to detect vulnerabilities. dynamic analysis, on
   the other hand, detects the vulnerabilities that are dependent on the
   run-time behaviour of the application and cannot be detected using
   static analysis. the model is evaluated against different applications
   with different security vulnerabilities. compared with other detection
   platforms, our model detects information leaks as well as insecure
   network requests alongside other commonly detected flaws that harm
   users' privacy. the code is available through a github repository for

   engagement with a health app is dependent on the usability and
   functionality of the app. while numerous studies have attempted to
   evaluate health apps, there is a paucity of published methods that
   adequately recognize client experiences in the academic evaluation of
   apps for chronic conditions.
   objective: this paper reports (1) a protocol to shortlist health apps
   for academic evaluation, (2) synthesis of a checklist to screen health
   apps for quality and reliability, and (3) a proposed method to
   theoretically evaluate usability of health apps, with a view towards
   identifying one or more apps suitable for clinical assessment.
   methods: a preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and
   meta-analyses (prisma) flow diagram was developed to guide the selection
   of the apps to be assessed. the screening checklist was thematically
   synthesized with reference to recurring constructs in published
   checklists and related materials for the assessment of health apps. the
   checklist was evaluated by the authors for face and construct validity.
   the proposed method for evaluation of health apps required the design of
   procedures for raters of apps, dummy data entry to test the apps, and
   analysis of raters' scores.
   results: the prisma flow diagram comprises 5 steps: filtering of
   duplicate apps; eliminating non-english apps; removing apps requiring
   purchase, filtering apps not updated within the past year; and
   separation of apps into their core functionality. the screening
   checklist to evaluate the selected apps was named the app chronic
   disease checklist, and comprises 4 sections with 6 questions in each
   section. the validity check verified classification of, and ambiguity
   in, wording of questions within constructs. the proposed method to
   evaluate shortlisted and downloaded apps comprises instructions to
   attempt set-up of a dummy user profile, and dummy data entry to
   represent in-range and out-of-range clinical measures simulating a range
   of user behaviors. a minimum score of 80\% by consensus (using the
   intraclass correlation coefficient) between raters is proposed to
   identify apps suitable for clinical trials.
   conclusions: the flow diagram allows researchers to shortlist health
   apps that are potentially suitable for formal evaluation. the evaluation
   checklist enables quantitative comparison of shortlisted apps based on
   constructs reported in the literature. the use of multiple raters, and
   comparison of their scores, is proposed to manage inherent subjectivity
   in assessing user experiences. initial trial of the combined protocol is
   planned for apps pertaining to the self-monitoring of asthma; these
   results will be reported elsewhere.}},

  abstract       = {{background: stroke is the third-leading cause of death and the leading
   cause of long-term neurological disability in the world. cognitive,
   communication, and physical weakness combined with environmental changes
   frequently cause changes in the roles, routines, and daily occupations
   of stroke sufferers. educational intervention combines didactic and
   interactive intervention, which combines the best choices for teaching
   new behaviors since it involves the active participation of the patient
   in learning. nowadays, there are many types of interventions or means to
   increase adherence to treatment.
   objective: the aim of this study is to enable patients who have suffered
   stroke and been discharged to their homes to improve the performance of
   the activities of daily living (adl) in their home environment, based on
   advice given by the therapist. a secondary aim is that these patients
   continue the treatment through a reminder app installed on their mobile
   phones.
   methods: this study is a clinical randomized controlled trial. the total
   sample will consist of 80 adults who have suffered a stroke with
   moderate severity and who have been discharged to their homes in the 3
   months prior to recruitment to the study. the following tests and scales
   will be used to measure the outcome variables: barthel index, the
   functional independence measure, the mini-mental state examination, the
   canadian neurological scale, the stroke impact scale-16, the trunk
   control test, the modified rankin scale, the multidimensional scale of
   perceived social support, the quality of life scale for stroke, the
   functional reach test, the romberg test, the time up and go test, the
   timed-stands test, a portable dynamometer, and a sociodemographic
   questionnaire. descriptive analyses will include mean, standard
   deviation, and 95\% confidence intervals of the values for each
   variable. the kolmogov-smirnov (ks) test and a 2x2 mixed-model analysis
   of variance (anova) will be used. intergroup effect sizes will be
   calculated (cohen's d).
   results: currently, the study is in the recruitment phase and
   implementation of the intervention has begun. the authors anticipate
   that during 2015 the following processes should be completed:
   recruitment, intervention, and data collection. it is expected that the
   analysis of all data and the first results should be available in
   early-to-mid 2016.
   conclusions: an educational intervention based on therapeutic home
   advice and a reminder app has been developed by the authors with the
   intention that patients who have suffered stroke perform the adl more
   easily and use their affected limbs more actively in the adl. the use of
   reminders via mobile phone is proposed as an innovative tool to increase
   treatment adherence in this population.}},

   nevertheless, the fundamentally new and unknown malware remain an issue.

   malicious for future inspection by anti-virus teams. sherlockdroid
   consists of marketplace crawlers, code-level property extractors and a

   looks malicious or not, based on some prior learning. in our tests, we
   extracted properties and classified over 480k applications. during two

   improve shock margins to prevent failures of solder joints in the case
   of sudden drop of the device.. different adhesives with a wide range of
   thermomechanical material properties have been in use with limited
   understanding and quantification of their impact on the temperature
   cycling reliability of the bga. the objective of this study is to
   comprehend the impact of temperature cycle on adhesives applied in the

   of adhesives for appropriate material selection. the study utilizes a
   computational mechanics based finite element analysis (fea) and a
   response surface methodology to perform a detailed numerical design of
   experiments (doe). results were validated with test data. the results of
   the study indicate that for many adhesives, accelerated temperature
   cycling tests can lead to wrong conclusions about adhesive performance
   in the field. moreover, the impact of corner glue on sj reliability in
   temperature cycling is strongly dependent on assembly parameters (board
   thickness, substrate thickness, pitch, etc.) which has not been
   typically accounted for in the past. in addition, impact of any
   individual glue thermo-mechanical material property (glass transition
   temperature, young's modulus, coefficient of thermal expansion) cannot
   be considered independently of other glue properties. all these
   interdependencies across geometric and material properties, as well as
   the temperature range the overall assembly is exposed to have been
   accounted for in defining adhesive property limits that would not
   compromise bga performance in temperature cycling.}},

   following stages: collection of information, logon and encryption, data
   transfer between dispositive, and development of android applications.
   next, it is presented the practical approach of the assessment using a
   variety of tools for the vulnerability analysis. the tests were
   performed using mobile applications from public institutions of the
   republic of ecuador. although android makes the necessary efforts to
   prevent security issues in mobile applications, security will be always
   a shared responsibility with the developers, since after the performed
   analysis, critical vulnerabilities were found, which are related to the
   application development.}},

  abstract       = {{background: a multitude of mhealth (mobile health) apps have been
   developed in recent years to support effective self-management of
   patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2.
   objective: we carried out a systematic review of all currently available
   diabetes apps for the operating systems ios and android. we considered
   the number of newly released diabetes apps, range of functions, target
   user groups, languages, acquisition costs, user ratings, available
   interfaces, and the connection between acquisition costs and user
   ratings. additionally, we examined whether the available applications
   serve the special needs of diabetes patients aged 50 or older by
   performing an expert-based usability evaluation.
   methods: we identified relevant keywords, comparative categories, and
   their specifications. subsequently, we performed the app review based on
   the information given in the google play store, the apple app store, and
   the apps themselves. in addition, we carried out an expert-based
   usability evaluation based on a representative 10\% sample of diabetes
   apps.
   results: in total, we analyzed 656 apps finding that 355 (54.1\%)
   offered just one function and 348 (53.0\%) provided a documentation
   function. the dominating app language was english (85.4\%, 560/656),
   patients represented the main user group (96.0\%, 630/656), and the
   analysis of the costs revealed a trend toward free apps (53.7\%,
   352/656). the median price of paid apps was (sic)1.90. the average user
   rating was 3.6 stars (maximum 5). our analyses indicated no clear
   differences in the user rating between free and paid apps. only 30
   (4.6\%) of the 656 available diabetes apps offered an interface to a
   measurement device. we evaluated 66 apps within the usability
   evaluation. on average, apps were rated best regarding the criterion
   ``comprehensibility{''} (4.0 out of 5.0), while showing a lack of
   ``fault tolerance{''} (2.8 out of 5.0). of the 66 apps, 48 (72.7\%)
   offered the ability to read the screen content aloud. the number of
   functions was significantly negative correlated with usability. the
   presence of documentation and analysis functions reduced the usability
   score significantly by 0.36 and 0.21 points.
   conclusions: a vast number of diabetes apps already exist, but the
   majority offer similar functionalities and combine only one to two
   functions in one app. patients and physicians alike should be involved
   in the app development process to a greater extent. we expect that the
   data transmission of health parameters to physicians will gain more
   importance in future applications. the usability of diabetes apps for
   patients aged 50 or older was moderate to good. but this result applied
   mainly to apps offering a small range of functions. multifunctional apps
   performed considerably worse in terms of usability. moreover, the
   presence of a documentation or analysis function resulted in
   significantly lower usability scores. the operability of accessibility
   features for diabetes apps was quite limited, except for the feature
   ``screen reader{''}.}},

  abstract          = {{two kinds of techniques, namely static and dynamic analysis, have been
   proposed in the literature to detect android malware. permissions and
   network traffic are the widely used detection attributes. malicious apps
   download malware at run-time and evade static permissions based
   detection while they can be detected by the network traffic. the malware
   that do not require network connectivity evade network traffic based
   detection which can be detected by permissions analysis. therefore, we
   believe that combining the network traffic and system permissions will
   enhance the detection rate. hence, in this work, we combine both the
   attributes and propose a hybrid detection model named ntpdroid, that
   extracts network traffic features and permissions from the applications.
   to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt towards
   combining these important sources of android malware detection. we train
   and test the proposed model using the fp-growth algorithm to generate
   the frequent patterns consisting of traffic features and permissions.
   experimental results demonstrate a detection accuracy of 94.25\%, better
   than frequent patterns obtained independently.}},

   aim: to test the proof of concept of a mobile application (heartmapp) in
   improving self-care management of patients with heart failure.
   method: an exploratory inquiry used a field study strategy with
   purposeful sampling and constant comparative analysis to test the proof
   of concept of heartmapp using the business model canvas framework.
   results: a total of 125 individuals, who were identified as potential
   candidates to use the heartmapp completed the interview over a
   seven-week period in 2016. constant comparative analysis indicated
   themes that skilled nursing facilities had increased readmissions.
   participants from skilled nursing facilities reported concern on lack of
   staffing, star rating, and malpractice claims. two types of patients
   were identified as early adapters of technology and those in denial.
   health care facilities reported challenges on transitional care, nurses
   struggle with engagement of patients on self-care management. to avoid
   readmission penalty, hospitals task home care agencies to keep the
   patients home for 30-days. while home care agencies rely on remote
   telemonitoring reported that current telemonitoring devices are costly
   to maintain, thus exploring novel technology.
   conclusion: the business model canvas provided directions for future

  abstract      = {{with the increasing capabilities of smart devices, keeping them secure
   has become a major concern. to mitigate that concern, over the last few
   years, several new classes of authentication schemes have been proposed.
   graphical authentication (ga) is one of those classes and is the focus
   of this paper. the ga schemes are more popular and preferable for smart
   devices due to their: heavily graphics-oriented nature, higher
   memorability over text-based schemes, and no additional hardware
   requirement. however, most of these ga schemes are unable to resist
   several prominent attacks, namely shoulder surfing, smudge, and brute
   force. therefore, in this paper, a new hybrid authentication scheme is
   proposed which seamlessly integrates two independent yet popular
   authentication schemes - passpoints and press touch code or ptc. the
   purpose of this new scheme is to ensure a higher level of security by
   resisting those prominent attacks. the proposed scheme is implemented on
   the android operating system and is tested on huawei p9 plus device, a
   pressure sensitivity screen enabled device, which is compulsory for the
   ptc scheme. the performance of the proposed technique is evaluated for
   security, functionality, and usability. when it is compared with other
   similar schemes, it outperforms the existing schemes.}},

  abstract  = {{multiple sclerosis (ms) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous
   system which leads to demyelination and neurodegeneration. the t and b
   cells, the body's immune cells, start attacking the brain and spinal
   cord, leading to a variety of symptoms. alemtuzumab is a recently
   approved disease-modifying therapy that has been shown to have a very
   high impact on ms. however, it has many potentially life-threatening
   side effects which patients are often not aware of. for treatments as
   effective and risky as alemtuzumab, patients who are considering it must
   be well-informed on the process and the potential side effects. patient
   education is vital to equip patients with knowledge on their disease and
   treatment, and has shown to be successful in improving the management of
   chronic diseases and increasing medication adherence. unfortunately, the
   language used is often too complex and at a higher reading level than
   average patients can comprehend, and available resources such as
   pamphlets and websites are often disorganized. this research proposes a
   radically different approach to patient education, using less formal
   channels such as a mobile application to improve health literacy, using
   lemtrada (r) (alemtuzumab) as an example. ms patients were involved in a
   codesign process to produce a series of user-friendly, intuitive and
   interactive graphical interfaces which propose plain language,
   illustrations, animations, audio and augmented reality components that
   aim to enhance patients' knowledge retention and recall. finally, nine
   ms patients along with a senior ms nurse tested the mobile application
   and answered a usability questionnaire that aimed to compare the
   delivery of information with typical websites and pamphlets. results
   suggested this approach to be highly user--friendly and engaging,
   improving patients' understanding of medical information considerably.
   this research illustrates more engaging channels to communicate with ms
   patients in order to enhance health literacy.}},

   applications (such as alarm clocks) to sensitive applications (such as
   banking)-these devices perform a vital function in today's world.
   because of the sensitive and critical information they contain, these
   devices are among the prime targets of hackers. the phone market is
   dominated by android-based phones. the open source nature of android has
   also spawned various security concerns because of the extensive spread
   of malware. accordingly, various classification algorithms (individual

   in this paper, we propose a novel android malware detection
   system-cendroid, which uses static features (api tags and permissions)
   along with a combination of clustering and ensemble of classifiers for
   classifying android apps as benign or malicious. with the proposed
   cluster-ensemble method, a comparative assessment is implemented on the
   performance of popular individual classifiers and their ensembles;
   experiments on three datasets of malicious and benign android
   applications are conducted as well. relevant statistical tests validate
   that our proposed system outperforms individual classifiers as well as

   methods: a total of 40 participants (22 women, 18 men; age = 72.2 +/-
   4.9 years) joined the investigation. muscular performance was assessed
   by measuring movement velocity in the csq with no external load using a
   validated smartphone application (powerlift for ios). functional
   capacity, balance, quality of life and cognitive status were evaluated
   using the hand-grip strength (hgs) test, the berg-scale, the euroqol 5d
   (eq-5d) and the mini mental state examination questionnaire (mmse).
   finally, participants were divided into two subgroups (n = 20) according
   to their velocity in the csq exercise.
   results: positive correlations were obtained between movement velocity
   in the csq and hgs (r = 0.76, p < 0.001), the berg-scale (r = 0.65, p <
   0.001), the eq-5d (r = 0.34, p = 0.03) and the mmse (r = 0.36, p =

   scores in the berg-scale (es = 1.15) and the hgs (es = 1.79), as well as
   likely higher scores in the mmse scale (es = 0.69).

   they support the use of a time-efficient, non-fatiguing test of muscular
   performance (i.e., the csq) to evaluate functional capacity and mental

   during the usability tests, the preservice teachers were asked to
   evaluate the affordances and limitations of selected educational mobile
   apps from their particular subject domains. their interactions with and
   evaluations of the mobile apps were collected through think-aloud
   sessions and interviews. qualitative analysis revealed preservice
   teachers' evaluation criteria in five categories such as pedagogy,
   technical usability, content, connectivity, and contextuality. the
   results point to recommendations for future research on evaluating the
   capabilities of existing mobile apps with key players such as in-service

   alleviate battery consumption on smartphones and to backup user's data
   on-the-fly. indeed, many recent works focus on frameworks that enable
   mobile computation offloading to software clones of smartphones on the
   cloud and on designing cloud-based backup systems for the data stored in
   our devices. both mobile computation offloading and data backup involve
   communication between the real devices and the cloud. this communication
   does certainly not come for free. it costs in terms of bandwidth (the
   traffic overhead to communicate with the cloud) and in terms of energy
   (computation and use of network interfaces on the device).
   in this work we study the feasibility of both mobile computation
   offloading and mobile software/data backups in real-life scenarios. in
   our study we assume an architecture where each real device is associated
   to a software clone on the cloud. we consider two types of clones: the
   off-clone, whose purpose is to support computation offloading, and the
   back-clone, which comes to use when a restore of user's data and apps is
   needed. we give a precise evaluation of the feasibility and costs of
   both off-clones and back-clones in terms of bandwidth and energy
   consumption on the real device. we achieve this through measurements
   done on a real testbed of 11 android smartphones and an equal number of
   software clones running on the amazon ec2 public cloud. the smartphones

  abstract             = {{background: evaluating the quality of mobile health apps for weight loss
   and weight management is important to understand whether these can be
   used for obesity prevention and treatment. recent reviews call for more
   research on multidimensional aspects of app quality, especially
   involving end users, as there are already many expert reviews on this
   domain. however, no quantitative study has investigated how laypersons
   see popular apps for weight management and perceive different dimensions
   of app quality.
   objective: this study aimed to explore how laypersons evaluate the
   quality of 6 free weight management apps (my diet coach, sparkpeople,
   lark, myfitnesspal, myplate, and my diet diary), which achieved the
   highest quality ratings in a related and recent expert review.
   methods: a user-centered study was conducted with 36 employees of a
   lebanese university. participants enrolled in the study on a rolling
   basis between october 2016 and march 2017. participants were randomly
   assigned an app to use for 2 weeks. app quality was evaluated at the end
   of the trial period using the mobile app rating scale user version
   (umars). umars assesses the dimensions of engagement, functionality,
   aesthetics, information, and subjective quality on 5-point scales.
   internal consistency and interrater agreement were examined. the
   associations between umars scores and users' demographic characteristics
   were also explored using nonparametric tests. analyses were completed in
   november 2017.
   results: overall, the 6 apps were of moderately good quality (median
   umars score 3.6, interquartile range {[}iqr] 0.3). the highest total
   umars scores were achieved by lark (mean 4.0 {[}sd 0.5]) and myplate
   (mean 3.8 {[}sd 0.4]), which also achieved the highest subjective
   quality scores (lark: mean 3.3 {[}sd 1.4]; myplate: mean 3.3 {[}sd
   0.8]). functionality was the domain with the highest rating (median 3.9,
   iqr 0.3), followed by aesthetics (median 3.7, iqr 0.5), information
   (median 3.7, iqr 0.1), and engagement (median 3.3, iqr 0.2). subjective
   quality was judged low (median 2.5, iqr 0.9). overall, subjective
   quality was strongly and positively related (p<.001) with total umars
   score (rho=.75), engagement (rho=.68), information, and aesthetics
   (rho=.60) but not functionality (rho=.40; p=.02). higher engagement
   scores were reported among healthy (p=.003) and obese individuals
   (p=.03), who also showed higher total umars (p=.04) and subjective
   quality (p=.05) scores.
   conclusions: although the apps were considered highly functional, they
   were relatively weak in engagement and subjective quality scores,
   indicating a low propensity of using the apps in the future. as
   engagement was the subdomain most strongly associated with subjective
   quality, app developers and researchers should focus on creating
   engaging apps, holding constant the functionality, aesthetics, and
   information quality. the tested apps (in particular lark and myplate)
   were perceived as more engaging and of higher quality among healthy,
   obese individuals, making them a promising mode of delivery for
   self-directed interventions promoting weight control among the sampled
   population or in similar and comparable settings.}},

  abstract             = {{background: with thousands of health apps in app stores globally, it is
   crucial to systemically and thoroughly evaluate the quality of these
   apps due to their potential influence on health decisions and outcomes.
   the mobile app rating scale (mars) is the only currently available tool
   that provides a comprehensive, multidimensional evaluation of app
   quality, which has been used to compare medical apps from american and
   european app stores in various areas, available in english, italian,
   spanish, and german. however, this tool is not available in arabic.
   objective: this study aimed to translate and adapt mars to arabic and
   validate the tool with a sample of health apps aimed at managing or
   preventing obesity and associated disorders.
   methods: we followed a well-established and defined ``universalist{''}
   process of cross-cultural adaptation using a mixed methods approach.
   early translations of the tool, accompanied by confirmation of the
   contents by two rounds of separate discussions, were included and
   culminated in a final version, which was then back-translated into
   english. two trained researchers piloted the mars in arabic (mars-ar)
   with a sample of 10 weight management apps obtained from google play and
   the app store. interrater reliability was established using intraclass
   correlation coefficients (iccs). after reliability was ascertained, the
   two researchers independently evaluated a set of additional 56 apps.
   results: mars-ar was highly aligned with the original english version.
   the iccs for mars-ar (0.836, 95\% ci 0.817-0.853) and mars english
   (0.838, 95\% ci 0.819-0.855) were good. the mars-ar subscales were
   highly correlated with the original counterparts (p<.001). the lowest
   correlation was observed in the area of usability (r=0.685), followed by
   aesthetics (r=0.827), information quality (r=0.854), engagement
   (r=0.894), and total app quality (r=0.897). subjective quality was also
   highly correlated (r=0.820).
   conclusions: mars-ar is a valid instrument to assess app quality among
   trained arabic-speaking users of health and fitness apps. researchers
   and public health professionals in the arab world can use the overall
   mars score and its subscales to reliably evaluate the quality of weight
   management apps. further research is necessary to test the mars-ar on
   apps addressing various health issues, such as attention or anxiety
   prevention, or sexual and reproductive health.}},

   globally with more than 1.9 billion overweight adults. in lebanon, the
   prevalence of obesity and overweight is 65.4\% combined. risk factors of
   obesity and overweight are preventable and can be addressed by
   modifications in the environment and in an individual's lifestyle.
   mobile technologies are increasingly used in behavioral, self-directed
   weight management interventions, providing users with additional
   opportunities to attain weight control (weight loss, weight gain
   prevention, etc). mobile apps may allow for the delivery of just-in-time
   adaptive interventions (jitais), which provide support through skill
   building, emotional support, and instrumental support, following the
   participants' progress. a few commercially available apps offer jitai
   features, but no studies have tested their efficacy.
   objective: the primary objective of this study is to examine the
   feasibility of a self-directed weight loss intervention, targeting
   employees of an academic institution, using a virtual coaching app with
   jitai features (lark) and a self-help calorie-counting app
   (myfitnesspal). the secondary objective is to estimate the effects of
   the intervention on main study outcomes.
   methods: this study is a single-center, parallel, randomized controlled
   trial with 2 study arms (intervention and control). participants will be
   randomly allocated in equal proportions to the intervention (lark) and
   control groups (myfitnesspal). to be eligible for this study,
   participants must be employed full-or part-time at the university or its
   medical center, able to read english, have a smartphone, and be
   interested in controlling their weight. recruitment strategies entail
   email invitations, printed posters, and social media postings. we will
   assess quantitative rates of recruitment, adherence, and retention,
   self-reported app quality using the user version of the mobile app
   rating scale. we will also assess changes in weight-related outcomes
   (absolute weight and waist circumference), behavioral outcomes (physical
   activity and diet), and cognitive factors (motivation to participate in
   the trial and to manage weight).
   results: waznapp was funded in june 2017, and recruitment started in
   march 2018.
   conclusions: this study will provide information as to whether the
   selected mobile apps offer a feasible solution for promoting weight
   management in an academic workplace. the results will inform a larger
   trial whose results might be replicated in similar workplaces in lebanon
   and the middle east and north africa region, and will be used as a
   benchmark for further investigations in other settings and similar

   objective: the objective of this study was to outline the theoretical
   foundation and iterative process of designing the ``sleep bunny,{''} a
   technology-assisted sleep extension intervention including a mobile
   phone app, wearable sleep tracker, and brief telephone coaching. we
   conducted a two-step process in the development of this intervention,

   that was completed by 2 participants with short sleep duration and a
   cardiovascular disease risk factor linked to short sleep duration (body
   mass index {[}bmi] >25).
   methods: all participants had habitual sleep duration <6.5 hours

   initial user testing in the development phase, and 2 participants
   completed field testing. participants in the user testing and field
   testing responded to open-ended surveys about the design and utility of

   freely downloadable mobile application simulator (mas) used by over one
   million healthcare professionals worldwide. nevertheless, to date, it

   students completed pre-test questionnaires and were then assessed on
   their ability to complete an undisclosed male urinary catheterisation

   was a potentially valuable tool to support long-term survivorship care
   plan objectives. portability, accessibility, and having one place for
   all contact, treatment, symptom tracking, and medication summaries was
   highly valued.
   conclusions: our pilot study indicates that smartsurvivor is a feasible
   and acceptable approach to meeting survivorship care objectives and the
   needs of both breast cancer survivors and their health care providers.
   exploration of mobile health options for supporting survivorship care
   plan needs is a promising area of research.}},

   the anti-virus has ensued. more recently, trusted hardware-based malware
   detection techniques are being developed on the premise that it is

   counters (hpcs) to detect malware for linux and android platforms. this
   paper, for the first time, presents an analytical framework to
   investigate the security provided by hpc-based malware detection
   techniques. the hpc readings are periodically monitored over the
   duration of the program execution for comparison with a golden hpc
   reading. we develop a mathematical framework to investigate the
   probability of malware detection, when hpcs are monitored at a
   pre-determined sampling interval. in other words, given a program, a set
   of hpcs, and a sampling rate, the framework can be employed to analyze
   the probability of malware detection.}},

   objective: the aim of this study was to seek to gain an understanding of
   how to incorporate a patient-provider mobile health (mhealth) platform
   to support the delivery of integrated primary care-based mental health
   services (collaborative care) to rural patients with posttraumatic
   stress disorder and/or bipolar disorder.
   methods: using the principles for digital development as a framework, we
   describe our experience designing, developing, and deploying a mobile
   system to support collaborative care. the system consists of a
   patient-facing smartphone app that integrates with a web-based clinical
   patient registry used by behavioral health care managers and consulting
   psychiatrists. throughout development, we engaged representatives from
   the system's two user types: (1) providers, who use the web-based
   registry and (2) patients, who directly use the mobile app. we extracted
   mobile metadata to describe the early adoption and use of the system by
   care managers and patients and report preliminary results from an in-app
   patient feedback survey that includes a system usability scale (sus).
   results: each of the nine principles for digital development is
   illustrated with examples. the first 10 patients to use the smartphone
   app have completed symptom measures on average every 14 days over an
   average period of 20 weeks. the mean sus score at week 8 among four

  abstract       = {{background
   studies of criteria-based assessment tools have demonstrated the
   feasibility of objectively evaluating ehealth interventions independent
   of empirical testing. however, current tools have not included some
   quality constructs associated with intervention outcome, such as
   persuasive design, behavior change, or therapeutic alliance. in
   addition, the generalizability of such tools has not been explicitly
   examined.
   objective
   the aim is to introduce the development and further analysis of the
   enlight suite of measures, developed to incorporate the aforementioned
   concepts and address generalizability aspects.
   methods
   as a first step, a comprehensive systematic review was performed to
   identify relevant quality rating criteria in line with the prisma
   statement. these criteria were then categorized to create enlight. the
   second step involved testing enlight on 42 mobile apps and 42 web-based
   programs (delivery mediums) targeting modifiable behaviors related to
   medical illness or mental health (clinical aims).
   results
   a total of 476 criteria from 99 identified sources were used to build
   enlight. the rating measures were divided into two sections: quality
   assessments and checklists. quality assessments included usability,
   visual design, user engagement, content, therapeutic persuasiveness,
   therapeutic alliance, and general subjective evaluation. the checklists
   included credibility, privacy explanation, basic security, and
   evidence-based program ranking. the quality constructs exhibited
   excellent interrater reliability (intraclass correlations=.77-.98,
   median.91) and internal consistency (cronbach alphas=.83-.90,
   median.88), with similar results when separated into delivery mediums or
   clinical aims. conditional probability analysis revealed that 100\% of
   the programs that received a score of fair or above (>= 3.0) in
   therapeutic persuasiveness or therapeutic alliance received the same
   range of scores in user engagement and content-a pattern that did not
   appear in the opposite direction. preliminary concurrent validity
   analysis pointed to positive correlations of combined quality scores
   with selected variables. the combined score that did not include
   therapeutic persuasiveness and therapeutic alliance descriptively
   underperformed the other combined scores.
   conclusions
   this paper provides empirical evidence supporting the importance of
   persuasive design and therapeutic alliance within the context of a
   program's evaluation. reliability metrics and preliminary concurrent
   validity analysis indicate the potential of enlight in examining ehealth
   programs regardless of delivery mediums and clinical aims.}},

   general practitioner (gp) with a painful musculoskeletal condition were
   recruited to use the app twice per day for 28days. face and construct

   environments and other environments, where people (their users)
   typically live. it is very important to mention that sensorial awareness
   of an environment depends on one's current location and equipment, as
   well as the equipment's real-time capabilities. personal sensorial
   information is considered to be the key factor for progress in the
   improvement of the productivity of everyday life and creation of a smart
   surrounding environment. this paper describes the design,
   implementation, and testing process of a new sensorial framework based
   on the current possibilities created by ubiquitous smart mobile devices
   with sensors, which involves computing power and battery power issues.
   the two parts of the proposed framework have been designed, implemented,
   and tested. the client part is represented by a front-end mobile
   application, and the back-end part is represented by a server-side
   application. the analysis of the data, captured during the testing
   phase, involves the analysis of the processing time, battery
   consumption, and transmitted data amount. this analysis reveals that
   transmission control protocol (tcp) and user datagram protocol (udp)
   protocols have a comparable performance, although tcp is preferable for
   use in local networks. in comparison to other solutions such as
   mobisense or feel the world framework, the final solution of the
   proposed and developed sensorial framework has two main capabilities,
   which are the security support and social networking possibilities. the
   advantage of the mobisense platform is the existence of several
   real-world applications, whereas the proposed sensorial framework needs

   applications to have feedback from early tests with users. on the basis
   of our field-working experience, we have designed odect, a high-level
   language and platform-independent application programming interface
   (api), ad hoc designed to meet the needs of typical applications for
   mobile devices (smart phones and pdas). odect aims at allowing
   application developers to create their prototypes focusing on the needs
   of the final users, without having to care about the low-level software
   that interacts with the rfid hardware. further, in an end-user
   developing (eud) approach, odect provides specific support for the
   application end-user herself to cope with typical problems of rfid
   applications in detecting objects. we describe in detail the features of
   the api and discuss the findings of a test with four programmers, where
   we analyse and evaluate the use of the api in four sample applications.
   we also present results of an end-user test, which investigated
   strengths and weaknesses of the territorial agenda (ta) concept. the ta
   is an rfid-based citizen guide that aids-through time- and
   location-based reminders-users in their daily activities in a city. the
   ta directly exploits eud features of odect, in particular concerning the
   possibility of linking detected objects with custom actions. copyright

  abstract  = {{purpose - the purpose of this paper is twofold: first, the authors
   empirically examine the effect of the perceived values of mobile banking
   (mb) applications on customers' e-trust, e-satisfaction and e-loyalty
   and second, the authors investigate the moderating role of customers'
   age in the relationship between perceived value of mb and e-trust.
   design/methodology/approach - a survey was conducted on a sample of 361
   tunisian banks' customers using mobile applications. structural equation
   modeling method was performed to test the research hypotheses.
   findings - the results of this research revealed that quality, price and
   emotional perceived values' dimensions of mb applications are predictors
   of customers' e-trust. within this spectrum, age acts as a moderator in
   these latter relationships. findings also suggested that e-trust has
   positive effects on e-satisfaction and e-loyalty.
   practical implications - this paper presented a reading grid for bank
   marketers allowing them to identify the levers they must focus their
   efforts on so as to retain the customers using mb applications. it also
   permits them to identify the needs and values of three generation of
   customers, namely baby boomers, generation x and generation y, so that
   they can offer better services for each group.
   originality/value - this paper sheds light on an innovative and
   unexplored topic in the literature. the authors broaden understanding of
   the relationship between the perceived values of mb applications,
   e-loyalty, e-trust and e-satisfaction. research devoted to investigate
   these different links through an integrative model does exist, yet
   embryonic. this study also highlights differences between three group of
   customer, namely baby boomers, generation x and generation y in terms of
   perceived values that builds their trust in the context of mb
   applications use.}},

   lack of easily accessible, evidence-based information for community

   have specifically focused on crystal methamphetamine.
   objective: this study aims to describe the co-design and beta testing of
   a mobile app to provide evidence-based, up-to-date information about
   crystal methamphetamine to the general community.
   methods: a mobile app about crystal methamphetamine was developed in
   2017. the development process involved multiple stakeholders (n=12),
   including technology and drug and alcohol experts, researchers, app
   developers, a consumer expert with lived experience, and community
   members. beta testing was conducted with australian general community
   members (n=34), largely recruited by the web through facebook
   advertising. participants were invited to use a beta version of the app
   and provide feedback about the content, visual appeal, usability,
   engagement, features, and functions. in addition, participants were
   asked about their perceptions of the app's influence on awareness,
   understanding, and help-seeking behavior related to crystal
   methamphetamine, and about their knowledge about crystal methamphetamine
   before and after using the app.
   results: the vast majority of participants reported the app was likely
   to increase awareness and understanding and encourage help-seeking. the
   app received positive ratings overall and was well received.
   specifically, participants responded positively to the high-quality
   information provided, usability, and visual appeal. areas suggested for
   improvement included reducing the amount of text, increasing engagement,
   removing a profile picture, and improving navigation through the
   addition of a ``back{''} button. suggested improvements were
   incorporated prior to the app's public release. app use was associated
   with an increase in perceived knowledge about crystal methamphetamine;
   however, this result was not statistically significant.
   conclusions: the cracks in the ice mobile app provides evidence-based
   information about the drug crystal methamphetamine for the general
   community. the app is regularly updated, available via the web and
   offline, and was developed in collaboration with experts and end users.
   initial results indicate that it is easy to use and acceptable to the

   check-in applications (lraci), suited to be implemented within
   smartphones, integrated in the cloud platform and representing a service
   for cloud end users. the algorithm, the performance of which is
   independent of the employed device, uses both global and hybrid
   positioning systems (gps/hps) and, in an opportunistic way, the presence
   of wi-fi access points (aps), through a new definition of wi-fi
   fingerprint (fp), which is proposed in this paper. this fp definition
   considers the order relation among the received signal strength (rss)
   rather than the absolute values. this is one of the main contributions
   of this paper. lraci is designed to be employed where traditional
   approaches, usually based only on gps/hps, fail, and is aimed at finding
   user location, with a room-level resolution, in order to estimate the
   overall time spent in the location, called permanence, instead of the
   simple presence. lraci allows automatic check-in in a given location
   only if the users' permanence is larger than a minimum amount of time,
   called stay length (sl), and may be exploited in the cloud. for example,
   if many people check-in in a particular location (e. g., a supermarket
   or a post office), it means that the location is crowded. using
   lraci-based data, collected by smartphones in the cloud and made
   available in the cloud itself, end users can manage their daily
   activities (e. g., buying food or paying a bill) in a more efficient
   way. the proposal, practically implemented over android operating
   system-based smartphones, has been extensively tested. experimental
   results have shown a location recognition accuracy of about 90\%,
   opening the door to real lraci employments. in this sense, a preliminary
   study of its application in the cloud, obtained through simulation, has
   been provided to highlight the advantages of the lraci features.}},

  abstract       = {{background: n-of-1 trials promise to help individuals make more informed
   decisions about treatment selection through structured experiments that
   compare treatment effectiveness by alternating treatments and measuring
   their impacts in a single individual. we created a digital platform that
   automates the design, administration, and analysis of n-of-1 trials. our
   first n-of-1 trial, the app-based brain boost study, invited individuals
   to compare the impacts of two commonly consumed substances (caffeine and
   l-theanine) on their cognitive performance.
   objective: the purpose of this study is to evaluate critical factors
   that may impact the completion of n-of-1 trials to inform the design of
   future app-based n-of-1 trials. we will measure study completion rates
   for participants that begin the brain boost study and assess their
   associations with study duration (5, 15, or 27 days) and notification
   level (light or moderate).
   methods: participants will be randomized into three study durations and
   two notification levels. to sufficiently power the study, a minimum of
   640 individuals must begin the study, and 97 individuals must complete
   the study. we will use a multiple logistic regression model to discern
   whether the study length and notification level are associated with the
   rate of study completion. for each group, we will also compare
   participant adherence and the proportion of trials that yield
   statistically meaningful results.
   results: we completed the beta testing of the n1 app on a convenience
   sample of users. the brain boost study on the n1 app opened enrollment
   to the public in october 2019. more than 30 participants enrolled in the
   first month.
   conclusions: to our knowledge, this will be the first study to
   rigorously evaluate critical factors associated with study completion in
   the context of app-based n-of-1 trials.}},

   distress in patients with cancer. we hypothesized that health care
   professionals may benefit from a real-time mobile app to assist in the
   diagnosis and monitoring of breakthrough cancer pain (btcp).
   objective: this study aimed to test the usability, acceptability, and
   usefulness in real-world practice of the mobile app ines.dio developed
   for the management of patients with btcp.
   methods: this study consisted of a survey of a multidisciplinary sample
   of 175 physicians who evaluated the mobile app after testing it with 4
   patients with btcp each (for a total of 700 patients). the digital
   profile of the physicians, use of the different resources contained in
   the app, usefulness of the resources, acceptability, usability,
   potential improvements, intention to use, and additional resources to
   add were recorded.
   results: of the 175 physicians, 96\% (168/175) were working in public
   hospitals. they had an average of 12 (sd 7) years of experience in btcp
   and almost all (174/175, 99.43\%) had an active digital profile. the
   eastern cooperative oncology group and karnofsky performance scales, the
   visual analogue scale, and the davies algorithm to diagnose btcp were
   the most frequently used tools with patients and were assessed as very
   useful by more than 80\% (140/175) of physicians. the majority (157/175,
   90\%) answered that app ines.dio was well designed and 94\% (165/175)
   would probably or very probably recommend it to other colleagues. more
   than two-thirds indicated that the report provided by the app was worth
   being included in patients' clinical records. the most valued resource
   in the app was the recording of the number, duration, and intensity of
   pain flares each day and baseline pain control to enhance diagnosis of
   btcp. additional patient-oriented cancer pain educational content was
   suggested for inclusion in future versions of app ines.dio.
   conclusions: our study showed that app ines .dio is easy to use and
   useful for physicians to help diagnose and monitor breakthrough pain in
   patients with cancer. participants suggested the implementation of
   additional educational content about breakthrough pain. they agreed on
   the importance of adding new clinical guidelines/protocols for the
   management of btcp, improving their communication skills with patients,
   and introducing an evidence based video platform that gathers new
   educational material on btcp.}},

   the usability of the app; after the first phase, the app was adjusted
   for a second phase. for this phase an extra 15 dentists were recruited
   from a group of 20 other dentists: five of them declined to participate.
   attention was paid to ensuring there was a proportional representation

   have been achieved so far since the launch of the desurbs project
   (www.desurbs.eu) in 2011. the project focuses on the development of a
   decision-support system portal (dssp) which integrates information, data
   and software modules representing city assets, hazards and processing
   models that simulate exposures to risks and potential compromise to
   safety and security. the use of the dssp will aid the design of safer
   and more resilient urban spaces. specifically, it provides security
   related scenarios with contextual information to support various types
   of users who specialise in urban spatial design and planning. the dssp
   is a web enabled system which is also adapted to mobile devices usage.
   it is supported with geographic maps and visualised aggregated data from
   a number of heterogeneous sources. a responsive web design which adapts
   to the resolution of smart mobile devices has also been achieved. that
   is, low powered mobiles can still provide map oriented data in a
   responsive fashion, while using multiple platforms (android and ios
   currently). the first dssp prototype employs the united kingdom crime
   statistics feed of year 2012 and analyses crime trends in 13 english
   cities (including greater london) which are distributed into four
   major-regions. the dssp displays raw crime data via a marker on a map,
   while they are aggregated under specific crime type threads and
   visualised as ``heat maps{''}. the specific visualisations are aligned
   to the various administrative regions such as neighbourhoods, catchments
   and postcodes. it also allows users to explore historical crime trends
   for a region over time, where crime statistics are contrasted. the
   scalability of the dssp was also tested under increasingly large
   datasets and numbers of users, with tested loads on the map server and
   the main django user application. the difference in speed between the
   mobile and desktop interfaces for a defined set of tasks using the
   application shall also be performed and presented in the near future.}},

   research in the last decade. numerous application analysis tools have
   been proposed in response to malicious, curious, or vulnerable apps.
   however, existing tools, and specifically, static analysis tools, trade
   soundness of the analysis for precision and performance, and are hence
   soundy. unfortunately, the specific unsound choices or flaws in the
   design of these tools are often not known or well-documented, leading to
   a misplaced confidence among researchers, developers, and users. this
   paper proposes the mutation-based soundness evaluation (mu se)
   framework, which systematically evaluates android static analysis tools
   to discover, document, and fix, flaws, by leveraging the well-founded
   practice of mutation analysis. we implement mu se as a semi-automated
   framework, and apply it to a set of prominent android static analysis
   tools that detect private data leaks in apps. as the result of an
   in-depth analysis of one of the major tools, we discover 13 undocumented
   flaws. more importantly, we discover that all 13 flaws propagate to
   tools that inherit the flawed tool. we successfully fix one of the flaws
   in cooperation with the tool developers. our results motivate the urgent
   need for systematic discovery and documentation of unsound choices in
   soundy tools, and demonstrate the opportunities in leveraging mutation
   testing in achieving this goal.}},

   adopting flame aerosol (fsp), coprecipitation, wet impregnation, and
   hydrothermal synthesis techniques. the resulting catalysts were explored
   for the selective catalytic reduction (scr) of nox using nh3 as
   reductant. in our studies, both the preparation method and the ce/w
   ratios were found to be critical variables for successful catalyst
   promotion. for the industrial realization, we have scaled up the scr
   activity tests. the microreactor catalytic formulations at simulated
   diesel engine exhaust conditions revealed that the ce-w (1:1 atomic
   ratio) and ce-w/tio2 catalysts showed high denox activity, while the
   other catalysts activity was found to be rather low. of interest is the
   finding that the ce-w/tio2/cordierite and ce-w (1:1 atomic
   ratio)/cordierite formulations show impressive deno(x) performance and
   high n-2 selectivity with respect to a commercial vanadia based
   reference currently used for mobile applications. to gain fundamental
   insights which may acquaint further improvements to the promoted
   ce-based catalysts, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and other
   characterizations were executed to study the relationship between
   catalyst surface and nox reduction activity. our xrd results indicate
   smaller lattice parameters of prepared catalysts compared to that of
   ceo2 (0.540 nm). the crystal lattice contraction is attributed to the
   lesser ionic radius of relevant foreign metal ions (w6+ = 0.067 nm and
   ti4+ = 0.074 nm) in relation to ce4+ (0.092 nm) in the host lattice.
   this lattice shrinkage elucidates the formation of solid solutions.
   these results illustrate that the synthesis technique and various
   promoters could indeed influence the lattice structures and electronic
   state of the active components. the xps results illustrate the higher
   atomic ratios of ce3+/(ce3+ + ce4+) 0.30 and 0.29 in ce-w/tio2 and ce-w
   (1:1) coprecipitation catalysts, respectively, compared to other
   samples. the higher surface ce3+/ce4+ ratio in ce-w (1:1)
   coprecipitation and ce-w/tio2 samples indicate the enrichment in surface
   oxygen vacancies, which results in activation of reactive molecules and
   enhanced adsorption of oxygen species in scr reaction. interestingly,
   the surface atomic ratio of ce3+/ce4+ and ce3+/cen(+) are interrelated
   to the scr activity of the individual catalysts.}},

  abstract     = {{military information systems require high levels of security to protect
   sensitive information within these systems. encrypted private networks
   are a common method of securing such systems. however these networks are
   not always available or practical to set up in time for scenarios which
   require real time information. this may force communications to utilise
   public infrastructure. securing communications for military mobile and
   web based systems over public networks poses a greater challenge
   compared to private encrypted networks. several security mechanisms from
   commercial enterprise and social networking systems were adopted and
   customised in order to secure cmore, a web based real time distributed
   command and control system developed by the council for scientific and
   industrial research (csir). this paper highlights the security
   architecture of cmore and discusses some of the successes and challenges
   encountered during the design and development of the cmore architecture.
   cmore has been successfully utilised and tested in several field
   experiments and operations. the resulting security architecture can be
   applied to other web and mobile systems.}},

  abstract             = {{background: accurately assessing the diets of children and adolescents
   can be problematic. use of technologies, such as mobile apps designed to
   capture food and beverages consumed at eating occasions with images
   taken using device-embedded cameras, may address many of the barriers to
   gathering accurate dietary intake data from adolescents.
   objective: the objectives of this study were to assess the willingness
   of adolescents to take images of food and beverages at their eating
   occasions using a novel mobile food record (mfr) and to evaluate the
   usability of the user confirmation component of the mfr app, referred to
   as the ``review process.{''}
   methods: mixed methods combining quantitative and qualitative protocols
   were used in this study. adolescents (11-15-year olds) attending a
   summer camp were recruited to participate in the study. first, the
   participants were asked to take images of foods and beverages consumed
   as meals and snacks for 2 consecutive days using the mfr app running on
   an iphone and the number of images taken was noted. this was followed by
   focus group sessions to evaluate usability, which was analyzed by
   content and themes. after using the mfr, a think-aloud method was used
   to evaluate the usability of the mfr method for reviewing
   system-identified foods (ie, the review process). a usability
   questionnaire was administered at the end of all activities.
   results: the mfr was accepted by the majority of the 24 boys and 17
   girls (n=41) but varied according to gender and eating occasion. girls
   were significantly more likely than boys to capture images of their
   eating occasions (fisher exact test, p=.03). participants were more
   likely to take images of their breakfasts (90\%, 36/40) and lunches
   (90\%, 72/80) and least likely to capture afternoon and evening snacks,
   54\% (43/80) and 40\% (32/80), respectively. the major themes from the
   focus groups with regard to using the mfr were games, rewards, and the
   need to know more about why they were using the app. results of the
   usability questionnaire indicated that including a game component would
   be important to increase willingness to use the mfr, and a high majority
   of the participants indicated a willingness to use the mfr for 7 days or
   more. the image review process was found to be easy to use except for
   some confusion with overlapping markers on the screen.
   conclusions: the adolescents' experiences with and feedback about the
   mfr highlighted the importance of increased training, reminders,
   entertainment (eg, games), and training with practice in using the
   device to capture complete dietary intake as part of their active
   lifestyles.}},

   smartphones provide to monitor patients with chronic neurologic
   disorders in their natural setting.
   methods: thirty-eight participant pairs (ms and cohabitant) aged 18-55
   years participated in the study. each participant received an android
   htc sensation 4g smartphone containing a custom application suite of 19
   tests capturing participant performance and patient-reported outcomes
   (pros). over 1 year, participants were prompted daily to complete one
   assigned test.
   results: a total of 22 patients with ms and 17 cohabitants completed the
   entire study. among patients withms, low scores on pros relating
   tomental and visual function were associated with dropout (p < 0.05). we
   illustrate several novel features of a smartphone platform. first,
   fluctuations in ms outcomes (e.g., fatigue) were assessed against an
   individual's ambient environment by linking responses to meteorological
   data. second, both response accuracy and speed for the ishihara color
   vision test were captured, highlighting the benefits of both active and
   passive data collection. third, a new trait, a person-specific learning
   curve in neuropsychological testing, was identified using spline
   analysis. finally, averaging repeated measures over the study yielded
   the most robust correlation matrix of the different outcome measures.
   conclusions: we report the feasibility of, and barriers to, deploying a
   smartphone platform to gather useful passive and active performance data
   at high frequency in an unstructured manner in the field. a smartphone

   for people in low- and middle-income countries.
   objective: the aim of this paper was to explore the patients'
   perspectives of conemo (emotional control, in spanish: control
   emocional), a technology-driven, psychoeducational, and nurse-supported
   intervention delivered via a smartphone app aimed at reducing depressive
   symptoms in people with diabetes, hypertension or both who attend public
   health care centers, as well as the nurses' feedback about their role
   and its feasibility to be scaled up.
   methods: this study combines data from 2 pilot studies performed in
   lima, peru, between 2015 and 2016, to test the feasibility of conemo.
   interviews were conducted with 29 patients with diabetes, hypertension
   or both with comorbid depressive symptoms who used conemo and 6 staff
   nurses who accompanied the intervention. using a content analysis
   approach, interview notes from patient interviews were transferred to a
   digital format, coded, and categorized into 6 main domains: the
   perceived health benefit, usability, adherence, user satisfaction with
   the app, nurse's support, and suggestions to improve the intervention.
   interviews with nurses were analyzed by the same approach and
   categorized into 4 domains: general feedback, evaluation of training,
   evaluation of study activities, and feasibility of implementing this
   intervention within the existing structures of health system.
   results: patients perceived improvement in their emotional health
   because of conemo, whereas some also reported better physical health.
   many encountered some difficulties with using conemo, but resolved them
   with time and practice. however, the interactive elements of the app,
   such as short message service, android notifications, and pop-up
   messages were mostly perceived as challenging. satisfaction with conemo
   was high, as was the self-reported adherence. overall, patients
   evaluated the nurse accompaniment positively, but they suggested
   improvements in the technological training and an increase in the amount
   of contact. nurses reported some difficulties in completing their tasks
   and explained that the conemo intervention activities competed with
   their everyday work routine.
   conclusions: using a nurse-supported smartphone app to reduce depressive
   symptoms among people with chronic diseases is possible and mostly
   perceived beneficial by the patients, but it requires context-specific
   adaptations regarding the implementation of a task shifting approach
   within the public health care system. these results provide valuable
   information about user feedback for those building mobile health
   interventions for depression.}},

   to 50\% discontinuing by 5 years. interventions are needed to support
   women taking aet after breast cancer. the aim of this study was to
   develop and pilot test an e-health app for this population.
   methods: two focus groups (n=15) and five interviews were conducted with
   women following treatment for early-stage breast cancer to assess the
   likely acceptability of an e-health app and to inform the content (phase
   i). following development of a prototype e-health app, a simple
   heuristic usability test was completed by five women in order to
   identify any design usability problems (phase ii). a further 18 women
   used the app for 1 month between july and august 2016, after which they
   were interviewed by telephone to collect their experiences and views of
   the app (phase iii).
   results: the prototype e-health app included evidence-based information
   on effectiveness of aet, an electronic side-effects diary, a peer
   support forum, a repeat prescription reminder, suggested strategies for
   facilitating adherence and managing any side effects that occur, and a
   link to further evidence and useful organizations for further
   information and support. the app was received positively by women. women
   found the app useful as it emphasized the importance of taking aet,
   helped them manage their side effects and provided details of support
   organizations, while offering empathy and exchange of suggestions for
   self-management strategies through the peer support forum.
   conclusion: overall, findings suggest that this novel e-health app has
   potential as a feasible medium for promoting adherence to aet. future
   research should evaluate the efficacy of the app in supporting women and
   promoting adherence.}},

   indicates how fast an app reacts to user actions. a soft hang occurs
   when the app's response time of handling a certain user action is longer
   than a user-perceivable delay. soft hangs can be caused by normal user
   interface (ui) rendering or some blocking operations that should not be
   conducted on the app's main thread (i.e., soft hang bugs). existing
   solutions on soft hang bug detection focus mainly on offline app code
   examination to find previously known blocking operations and then move
   them off the main thread. unfortunately, such offline solutions can fail
   to identify blocking operations that are previously unknown or hidden in
   libraries.
   in this paper, we present hang doctor, a runtime methodology that
   supplements the existing offline algorithms by detecting and diagnosing
   soft hangs caused by previously unknown blocking operations. hang doctor
   features a two-phase algorithm that first checks response time and
   performance event counters for detecting possible soft hang bugs with
   small overheads, and then performs stack trace analysis when diagnosis
   is necessary. a novel soft hang filter based on correlation analysis is
   designed to minimize false positives and negatives for high detection
   performance and low overhead. we have implemented a prototype of hang
   doctor and tested it with the latest releases of 114 real-world apps.
   hang doctor has identified 34 new soft hang bugs that are previously
   unknown to their developers, among which 62\%, so far, have been
   confirmed by the developers, and 68\% are missed by offline algorithms.}},

  abstract       = {{accountable care organizations (acos) seek sustainable innovation
   through the testing of new care delivery methods that promote shared
   goals among value-based health care collaborators. the morehouse choice
   accountable care organization and education system (mcaco-es), or
   (m-aco) is a physician led integrated delivery model participating in
   the medicare shared savings program (mssp) offered through the centers
   for medicare and medicaid services (cms) innovation center. the mssp
   establishes incentivized, performance-based payment models for
   qualifying health care organizations serving traditional medicare
   beneficiaries that promote collaborative efficiency models designed to
   mitigate fragmented and insufficient access to health care, reduce
   unnecessary cost, and improve clinical outcomes. the m-aco integration
   model is administered through participant organizations that include a
   multi-site community based academic practice, independent physician
   practices, and federally qualified health center systems (fqhcs). this
   manuscript aims to present a descriptive and exploratory assessment of
   health care programs and related innovation methods that validate m-aco
   as a reliable simulator to implement, evaluate, and refine m-aco's
   integration model to render value-based performance outcomes over time.
   a part of the research approach also includes early outcomes and lessons
   learned advancing the framework for ongoing testing of m-aco's
   integration model across independently owned, rural, and urban health
   care locations that predominantly serve low-income, traditional medicare
   beneficiaries, (including those who also qualify for medicaid benefits
   (also referred to as ``dual eligibles{''}). m-aco seeks to determine how
   integration potentially impacts targeted performance results. as a
   simulator to test value-based innovation and related clinical and
   business practices, m-aco uses enterprise-level data and advanced
   analytics to measure certain areas, including: 1) health program insight
   and effectiveness; 2) optimal implementation process and workflows that
   align primary care with specialists to expand access to care; 3) chronic
   care management/coordination deployment as an effective extender service
   to physicians and patients risk stratified based on defined clinical and
   social determinant criteria; 4) adoption of technology tools for patient
   outreach and engagement, including a mobile application for remote
   biometric monitoring and telemedicine; and 5) use of structured
   communication platforms that enable practitioner engagement and ongoing
   training regarding the shift from volume to value-based care delivery.}},

   diseases of the airways. enhancement of a patient's participation on
   clinical decisions is related to better results in control of diseases.
   to control ara, patients should monitor their symptoms, avoid triggers,
   and follow their treatment plan. this study described the challenges of
   developing a mobile application, called m.carat, that records the main
   events related to ara. materials and methods: the mobile application
   m.carat was developed for android (tm) (google, mountain view, ca) and
   iphone (r) (apple, san jose, ca) smartphones. it was developed using
   phonegap, which allows the development of applications for several
   mobile operating systems. to generate the user interface, jquery mobile,
   html, javascript, and css were used. despite the use of mobile
   development frameworks, some input and output elements had to be
   improved. to evaluate the interface, a pilot study was performed with
   eight users who performed 10 different tasks in the application. to
   synchronize m.carat with an online database, an algorithm was developed
   from scratch. this feature represents a major challenge because all the
   changes must be reflected in all devices. results: currently m.carat is
   a mobile application where ara patients fill out a questionnaire to
   assess the degree of control of ara and record their exacerbations,
   triggers, symptoms, medications, lung function tests, and visits to the
   doctor or the hospital. they also can receive information and news about
   ara, define medication and tasks notifications, and synchronize all
   records at caratnetwork.org with an online database. the evaluation
   showed some of the adopted solutions to improve interface usability did
   not work as expected. of the 80 total tasks tested the users had no
   difficulty in 37(46\%). most of the problems observed were easily
   solved. conclusions: m.carat is a mobile application for ara that may
   contribute to patient enablement. the development of m.carat suggests
   that mobile applications may introduce specific challenges that need new
   solutions.}},

  abstract       = {{background: flare-ups in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (jia) are
   characterized by joint pain and swelling and often accompanied with
   fatigue, negative emotions, and reduced participation in activities. to
   minimize the impact of jia on the physical and psychosocial development
   and well-being of young people (yp), it is essential to regularly
   monitor disease activity and side effects, as well as to support
   self-management such as adherence to treatment plans and engagement in
   general health-promoting behaviors. smartphone technology has the
   potential to engage yp with their health care through convenient
   self-monitoring and easy access to information. in addition, having a
   more accurate summary of self-reported fluctuations in symptoms,
   behaviors, and psychosocial problems can help both yp and health care
   professionals (hcps) better understand the patient's condition, identify
   barriers to self-management, and assess treatment effectiveness and
   additional health care needs. no comprehensive smartphone app has yet
   been developed in collaboration with yp with jia, their parents, and
   hcps involved in their care.
   objectives: the objective of this study was to design, develop, and
   evaluate the acceptability and usability of jiapp, a self-management
   smartphone app system for yp with jia and hcps.
   methods: we used a qualitative, user-centered design approach involving
   yp, parents, and hcps from the rheumatology team. the study was
   conducted in three phases: (1) phase i focused on developing consensus
   on the features, content, and design of the app; (2) phase ii was used
   for further refining and evaluating the app prototype; and (3) phase iii
   focused on usability testing of the app. the interview transcripts were
   analyzed using qualitative content analysis.
   results: a total of 29 yp (aged 10-23, median age 17) with jia, 7
   parents, and 21 hcps were interviewed. major themes identified as the
   ones that helped inform app development in phase i were: (1) remote
   monitoring of symptoms, well-being, and activities; (2) treatment
   adherence; and (3) education and support. during phase ii, three more
   themes emerged that informed further refinement of the app prototype.
   these included (4) adapting a reward system to motivate end users for
   using the app; (5) design of the app interface; and (6) clinical
   practice integration. the usability testing during phase iii
   demonstrated high rates of overall satisfaction and further affirmed the
   content validity of the app.
   conclusions: we present the development and evaluation of a smartphone
   app to encourage self-management and engagement with health care for yp
   with jia. the app was found to have high levels of acceptability and
   usability among yp and hcps and has the potential to improve health care
   and outcomes for this age group. future feasibility testing in a
   prospective study will firmly establish the reliability, efficacy, and
   cost-effectiveness of such an app intervention for patients with
   arthritis.}},

  abstract  = {{to model the behavior of channels in real-world mobile systems, ying
   introduced an extension of the pi-calculus by taking channel noise into
   account. unfortunately, this extension is not faithful in the sense that
   its semantics does not coincide with the standard one for the
   pi-calculus in the noise-free case. in this paper, we consider a simple
   variant of the pi-calculus, the asynchronous pi-calculus (a pi), which
   has been used for modeling some concurrent systems with asynchronous
   communication. to model these systems with noisy channels, we propose a
   faithful extension of a pi, called the a pi(n)-calculus. after giving a
   probabilistic transitional semantics of a pi(n), we introduce
   bisimilarity in a pi(n) and show that it is a partial input congruence.
   if a specification of a system is described as a process p in a pi and
   we view the behavior of p in a pi(n) as an implementation of the
   specification, then it is interesting to measure how far the behavior in
   a pi(n) is from that in a pi. we thus introduce the notion of
   reliability degree, which is based upon a new approximate bisimulation.
   we find that bisimilar agents may have different reliability degrees and
   even the agent with the greatest reliability degree may not be
   satisfactory. we thus appeal to shannon's noisy channel coding theorem
   and show that reliability degrees can be improved by employing coding
   techniques.}},

   commercially available medication adherence apps for the inclusion of
   behavior change techniques (bcts) and to conduct a usability analysis on
   a subset of apps with adolescents and young adults living with a chronic
   illness.
   methods medication adherence apps were identified via a search of itunes
   app store in august 2016. seventy-five apps meeting initial inclusion
   criteria were independently coded by two researchers for the
   presence/absence of 26 bcts. twenty adolescents and young adults (ages:
   13-20 years) with inflammatory bowel disease conducted usability testing
   on a subset of apps (n=4).
   results across 75 apps coded for presence/absence of 26 bcts, only 7
   unique bcts were identified. the number of bcts per app ranged from 2 to
   6, with an average of 3.3 bcts. in usability testing, quality ratings
   varied across apps. medisafe received the highest average scores on
   engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information subscales.
   medisafe and mytherapy ranked first and second, respectively, on overall
   quality and perceived impact ratings.
   conclusion content evaluation revealed only a limited number of bcts
   that have been translated to medication adherence apps. among apps with
   comparable content, clear user preferences emerged based on perceived
   quality and usability. greater collaboration is needed between
   psychologists and health technologists to incorporate more
   evidence-based bcts in apps. findings also indicate a need for app
   developers to consider and incorporate the preferences of younger end
   users to improve app quality and engagement for pediatric populations.}},

   6 to 12 months. when a battery hits the 6 months margin, it will start
   showing unwanted responses such as unstable start up and quick
   discharge. these responses must be avoided specially in times that the
   car is significantly needed to be in good condition, such as during an
   emergency or a long drive. it is an inconceivable scenario to be stuck
   in a place far from people. as a solution, the proponents designed a
   device that can automatically checked for the temperature, load current,
   voltage level, number of hours left before reaching critical voltage
   level and state of charge of a car battery via wireless technology in a
   real time manner using a mobile application with a dedicated storage for
   recording data every given period. the recording interval can be
   adjusted to what is desired by the user. furthermore, algorithms on
   statistically analyzing the recorded data is executed by the device
   itself which will be a helpful information on what preventive actions
   the user must do to improve the performance of its car battery and
   therefore, avoid further problems. also, the device uses a state
   estimation in achieving an almost zero steady state error of the
   parameters of the battery stated above that cannot be measured by a
   sensor such as the state of charge (soc) and remaining battery hours.
   after several testing and validation, it was found that the device where
   able to accurately predict the level of the parameters at a plus or
   minus 0.38 \% error. moreover, the feature of this device was made more
   interesting by adding a flexibility on its mean to communicate
   wirelessly. the system (the device and the mobile app) communicates
   using gsm, internet and bluetooth to increase its reliability. the user
   therefore has the options to manually or remotely switch loads in the
   vehicle. if in the event that the communication is loss, and the vehicle
   is approaching critical level, the device can be set to an
   ``auto-off{''} mode which automatically switch the loads off. there are
   instances that the loads is intended to be turned on purposively. this
   is why the user is given the option to enable this mode or not. most
   importantly, the device is tied up with a spare battery that is intended
   to be used for emergency jump start. thus, keeping an eye on the status
   of this spare battery is executed also on a regular interval.}},

   have high levels of distress, including depression and anxiety. recent
   research has focused on recognizing caregivers in need of psychosocial
   support to help them manage their distress. evidenced-based
   technological interventions have the potential to aid caregivers in
   managing distress.
   objective: the objective of our study was to describe caregiver
   perceptions of the usability and acceptability, and their suggestions
   for future adaptations, of a mobilized psychoeducation and skills-based
   intervention.
   methods: this study was a part of a larger trial of a mobilized
   psychoeducation and skills based intervention (psychoeducation and
   skills-based mobilized intervention {[}pep-pal]) for caregivers of
   patients with advanced illness. this substudy used a mixed-methods
   analysis of quantitative data from all 26 intervention participants and
   qualitative data from 14 intervention caregivers who completed the
   pep-pal intervention. the qualitative semistructured individual
   interviews, which we conducted within the first 4 weeks after
   participants completed the intervention, assessed the acceptability and
   usability of pep-pal. additionally, the qualitative interviews provided
   contextual evidence of how the intervention was helpful to interviewees
   in unanticipated ways. we conducted applied thematic analysis via
   independent review of transcripts to extract salient themes.
   results: overall, caregivers of patients with advanced cancer deemed
   pep-pal to be acceptable in all web-based sessions except for improving
   intimacy caregivers perceived the program to be of use across the areas
   they needed and in others that they had not anticipated. caregiver
   recommendations of key changes for the program were to include more
   variety in caregiver actors in sessions, change the title of improving
   intimacy to improving relationships, provide an audio-only option in
   addition to video, and change the format of the mobilized website
   program to a stand-alone mobile app.
   conclusions: the valuable feedback in key areas from individual
   interviews will be integrated into the final version of pep-pal that
   will be tested in a fully powered randomized clinical trial.}},

   suffers from back pain, which accounts for over 50\% of physical
   incapacity, permanent or temporary, among individuals in working-age. in
   most situations, this is caused by an incorrect posture, which causes
   changes in the spine structure. this paper proposes an instrumented vest
   for postural reeducation to address this issue. the vest has a set of
   inertial measurement unit (imu) sensors strategically placed to provide
   an accurate characterization of the spine profile. the sensor readings
   are classified by a central processing unit. in case of an incorrect
   posture, users are alerted by an audio signal and through vibration. the
   wearable system works in stand- alone mode, but can also communicate
   with external systems through an api. two applications were developed to
   communicate with the device through this api, one intended to run on a
   desktop computer and the other one for android devices. these
   applications monitor spine profiles in real time and notify the user of
   incorrect postures, among other functionalities. the device prototype
   and the applications have been tested by 10 individuals in two different
   settings, first without any kind of feedback and then with feedback
   enabled. the tests demonstrate the usability, accuracy and robustness of
   the system, proving its high level of reliability in classifying

   detection system that benefits from the detection performed by two
   popular personal devices: a smartphone and a smartwatch (both provided
   with an embedded accelerometer and a gyroscope). in the proposed
   architecture, a specific application in each component permanently
   tracks and analyses the patient's movements. diverse fall detection
   algorithms (commonly employed in the literature) were implemented in the
   developed android apps to discriminate falls from the conventional
   activities of daily living of the patient. as a novelty, a fall is only
   assumed to have occurred if it is simultaneously and independently
   detected by the two android devices (which can interact via bluetooth
   communication). the system was systematically evaluated in an
   experimental testbed with actual test subjects simulating a set of falls
   and conventional movements associated with activities of daily living.
   the tests were repeated by varying the detection algorithm as well as
   the pre-defined mobility patterns executed by the subjects (i.e., the
   typology of the falls and non-fall movements). the proposed system was
   compared with the cases where only one device (the smartphone or the
   smartwatch) is considered to recognize and discriminate the falls. the
   obtained results show that the joint use of the two detection devices
   clearly increases the system's capability to avoid false alarms or
   `false positives' (those conventional movements misidentified as falls)
   while maintaining the effectiveness of the detection decisions (that is
   to say, without increasing the ratio of `false negatives' or actual
   falls that remain undetected).}},

   proposed just-in-time (jit) bug prediction with the goal of detecting
   bugs at commit-level. while this topic has been extensively investigated
   in the context of traditional systems, to the best of our knowledge,
   only a few preliminary studies assessed the performance of the technique
   in a mobile environment, by applying the metrics proposed by kamei et
   al. in a within-project scenario. the results of these studies
   highlighted that there is still room for improvement. in this paper, we
   faced this problem to understand (i) which kamei et al.'s metrics are
   useful in the mobile context, (ii) if different classifiers impact the
   performance of cross-project jit bug prediction models and (iii) whether
   the application of ensemble techniques improves the capabilities of the
   models. to carry out the experiment, we first applied a feature
   selection technique, i.e., infogain, to filter relevant features and
   avoid models multicollinearity. then, we assessed and compared the
   performance of four different wellknown classifiers and four ensemble
   techniques. our empirical study involved 14 apps and 42, 543 commits

   audiovisual prompts, nrp prompt, can help novice nrp providers learn the
   nrp algorithm more effectively and therefore improve their nrp
   performance. methods first- and second-year residents from family
   medicine and obstetrics and gynecology attending nrp training were
   randomized into intervention and control groups. resident pairs used
   standard visual aids with nrp prompt (intervention) or visual aids only
   (control) in two simulated neonatal resuscitation training sessions with
   each resident taking turns as a team leader. pairs were then evaluated
   in a third simulation that was video recorded, where neither group used
   cognitive aids. the primary outcome was comparing resuscitation
   performance. secondary outcomes included the following: times to
   positive-pressure ventilation, intubation, and chest compressions.
   results thirty-nine residents participated, of which 18 received the
   intervention. neonatal resuscitation program performance scores did not
   significantly differ (p = 0.69). wilcoxon rank-sum tests showed no
   significant differences in secondary outcomes of times to
   positive-pressure ventilation (p = 0.43), intubation (p = 0.44), or
   chest compressions (p = 0.35). conclusions training using nrp prompt did
   not improve performance scores in simulated neonatal resuscitations
   immediately after training. potential reasons include voice prompts in
   their current format being distracting and lack of customizability to
   user preferences. future development of prompting applications should
   apply a user-centered design approach to optimize the ability to meet

   challenging issue to reduce discovery delay among mobile nodes, so that
   mobile nodes can establish connection quickly once they are within each
   other's vicinity. existing discovery designs are essentially pairwise
   based, in which discovery is passively achieved when two nodes are
   prescheduled to wake up at the same time. in contrast, this work reduces
   discovery delay significantly by proactively referring wake-up schedules
   among a group of nodes. since proactive references incur additional
   overhead, we introduce a novel selective reference mechanism based on
   spatiotemporal properties of neighborhood and the mobility of nodes. our
   quantitative analysis indicates that the discovery delay of our
   group-based mechanism is significantly smaller than that of the pairwise
   one. our testbed experiments using 40 sensor nodes and extensive
   simulations confirm the theoretical analysis, showing one order of
   magnitude reduction in discovery delay compared with legacy pairwise
   methods in dense, uniformly distributed sensor networks with at most 8.8
   percent increase in energy consumption.}},

   developed. however, the existing apps have been developed without
   involving relevant stakeholders and were not subjected to mobile health
   app guidelines. in addition, the usability and utility of these apps
   have not been tested with end users.
   objective: this study aimed to describe the usability and utility
   testing of a newly developed medication adherence app-med assist-among
   ambulatory care patients in malaysia.
   methods: the med assist app was developed based on the theory of planned
   behavior and the nielson usability model. beta testing was conducted
   from march to may 2016 at a primary care clinic in kuala lumpur.
   ambulatory care patients who scored >= 40\% on the electronic health
   literacy scale, were aged years, and were taking two or more long-term
   medications were recruited. two rounds of in-depth interviews were
   conducted with each participant. the first interview, which was
   conducted upon participant recruitment, was to assess the usability of
   med assist. participants were asked to download med assist on their
   phone and perform two tasks (register themselves on med assist and enter
   at least one medication). participants were encouraged to ``concurrently
   think aloud{''} when using med assist, while nonverbal cues were
   observed and recorded. the participants were then invited for a second
   interview (conducted >= 7 days after the first interview) to assess the
   utility of med assist after using the app for 1 week. this was done
   using ``retrospective probing{''} based on a topic guide developed for
   utilities that could improve medication adherence.
   results: usability and utility testing was performed for the med assist
   app (version p4). a total of 13 participants were recruited (6 men, 7
   women) for beta testing. three themes emerged from the usability
   testing, while three themes emerged from the utility testing. from the
   usability testing, participants found med assist easy to use and user
   friendly, as they were able to complete the tasks given to them.
   however, the details required when adding a new medication were found to
   be confusing despite displaying information in a hierarchical order.
   participants who were caregivers as well as patients found the
   multiple-user support and pill buddy utility useful. this suggests that
   med assist may improve the medication adherence of patients on multiple
   long-term medications.
   conclusions: the usability and utility testing of med assist with end
   users made the app more patient centered in ambulatory care. from the
   usability testing, the overall design and layout of med assist were
   simple and user friendly enough for participants to navigate through the
   app and add a new medication. from the participants' perspectives, med
   assist was a useful and reliable tool with the potential to improve
   medication adherence. in addition, utilities such as multiple user
   support and a medication refill reminder encouraged improved medication
   management.}},

   thus, the present study investigated their influence on physical
   education. a mobile application for novice and advanced basketball
   players was developed and tested in a course teaching 3-on-3 basketball
   and various teaching methods were implemented to test for the effects of
   gender differences on learning outcome. the participants were students
   enrolled in the aforementioned course in a university in central taiwan.
   326 participants were included in the study, of whom 238 were male and
   88 were female. the duration of the experiment was 5 weeks between may
   and june 2017, during which the correctness of moves, maneuverability,
   teamwork, sense of balance, and adaptability of the participants were
   evaluated and graded as their learning outcome. the research team
   observed the participants each week to gather empirical data for

  abstract     = {{growing interest is currently being paid to the possibility of offering
   a wide range of satellite telecommunications services (including
   wideband services, the so-called multimedia) to mobile terminals (mts),
   either land-mobile, maritime or aeronautical, operating in the 20/30 ghz
   range (shf) and eventually in the 40/50 ghz range (ehf). this interest
   is also witnessed by the fact that the european commission has endorsed
   an on-going project (''secoms / abate'') coordinated by alenia spazio
   (italy) aiming to study an shf / ehf satellite system architecture
   suitable for the provision of wideband land-mobile and aeronautical
   services, to develop the required technologies and to validate the
   assumptions by means of field trials (over the italsat satellite).
   an important requirement for all mobile satellite systems is the need to
   contain the mt cost, this objective certainly representing; a challenge
   when mts operate in the shf / ehf range. at this regard, key issues will
   be the selection of an efficient access technique, the adoption of an
   implementation approach featuring an high hardware integration level
   while still allowing to suit diversified user needs, and flexibility
   with regard to future architecture evolutions. in particular, the modem
   is the mt subsystem for which the integration efforts will prove to be
   most effective, it being conceivable to realize all functions in a
   single application-specific integrated circuit (asic) and a digital
   signal processor (dsp).
   space engineering is committed to developing the demonstrator modems to
   be used for the secoms / abate code-division multiple access (cdma) and
   multi-frequency time-division multiple access (mf-tdma) field trials.
   although, for budget reasons, the hardware integration level will be
   more limited, the modem will be designed bearing in mind the final
   objective of a single asic + dsp for the commercial product.
   this paper, after summarizing the operating scenario and its impact on
   the mt design, discusses the modem subsystem, encompassing items such as
   modem architecture, expected performance, power consumption budget,
   growth capability (e.g. in terms of bit-rate, number of channels, etc.),
   re-use of building modules in an evolving scenario (cdma --> tdma,
   different applications, etc.), hardware integration strategies, and
   finally a novel approach for design verification of complex systems
   including standard dsps and semi-custom chips (asics and
   field-programmable gate arrays - fpgas).}},

   these issues are experienced by a software engineer who has struggled

  abstract  = {{purpose - the functionality of personal mobile electronics continues to
   increase, in turn driving the demand for higher logic-to-memory
   bandwidth. however, the number of inputs/outputs supported by the
   current packaging technology is limited by the smallest achievable
   electrical line spacing, and the associated noise performance. also, a
   growing trend in mobile systems is for the memory chips to be stacked to
   address the growing demand for memory bandwidth, which in turn gives
   rise to heat removal challenges. the glass interposer substrate is a
   promising packaging technology to address these emerging demands,
   because of its many advantages over the traditional organic substrate
   technology. however, glass has a fundamental limitation, namely low
   thermal conductivity (similar to 1w/mk). the purpose of this paper is to
   quantify the thermal performance of glass interposer-based electronic
   packages by solving a multi-scale heat transfer problem for an
   interposer structure. also, this paper studies the possible improvement
   in thermal performance by integrating a fluidic heat spreader or vapor
   chamber within the interposer.
   design/methodology/approach - this paper illustrates the multi-scale
   modeling approach applied for different components of the interposer,
   including through package vias (tpvs) and copper traces. for
   geometrically intricate and repeating structures, such as interconnects
   and tpvs, the unit cell effective thermal conductivity approach was
   used. for non-repeating patterns, such as copper traces in
   redistribution layer, cad drawing-based thermal resistance network
   analysis was used. at the end, the thermal performance of vapor chamber
   integrated within a glass interposer was estimated by using an enhanced
   effective thermal conductivity, calculated from the published thermal
   resistance data, in conjunction with the analytical expression for
   thermal resistance for a given geometry of the vapor chamber.
   findings - the limitations arising from the low thermal conductivity of
   glass can be addressed by using copper structures and vapor chamber
   technology.
   originality/value - a few reports can be found on thermal performance of
   glass interposers. however thermal characteristics of glass interposer
   with advanced cooling technology have not been reported.}},

  abstract             = {{background: a smartphone is a promising tool for daily cardiovascular
   measurement and mental stress monitoring. a smartphone camera-based
   photoplethysmography (ppg) and a low-cost thermal camera can be used to
   create cheap, convenient, and mobile monitoring systems. however, to
   ensure reliable monitoring results, a person must remain still for
   several minutes while a measurement is being taken. this is cumbersome
   and makes its use in real-life situations impractical.
   objective: we proposed a system that combines ppg and thermography with
   the aim of improving cardiovascular signal quality and detecting stress
   responses quickly.
   methods: using a smartphone camera with a low-cost thermal camera added
   on, we built a novel system that continuously and reliably measures 2
   different types of cardiovascular events: (1) blood volume pulse and (2)
   vasoconstriction/dilation-induced temperature changes of the nose tip.
   17 participants, involved in stress-inducing mental workload tasks,
   measured their physiological responses to stressors over a short time
   period (20 seconds) immediately after each task. participants reported
   their perceived stress levels on a 10-cm visual analog scale. for the
   instant stress inference task, we built novel low-level feature sets
   representing cardiovascular variability. we then used the automatic
   feature learning capability of artificial neural networks to improve the
   mapping between the extracted features and the self-reported ratings. we
   compared our proposed method with existing hand-engineered
   features-based machine learning methods.
   results: first, we found that the measured ppg signals presented high
   quality cardiac cyclic information (mean psqi: 0.755; sd 0.068). we also
   found that the measured thermal changes of the nose tip presented
   high-quality breathing cyclic information and filtering helped extract
   vasoconstriction/dilation-induced patterns with fewer respiratory
   effects (mean psqi: from 0.714 to 0.157). second, we found low
   correlations between the self-reported stress scores and the existing
   metrics of the cardiovascular signals (ie, heart rate variability and
   thermal directionality) from short measurements, suggesting they were
   not very dependent upon one another. third, we tested the performance of
   the instant perceived stress inference method. the proposed method
   achieved significantly higher accuracies than existing precrafted
   features-based methods. in addition, the 17-fold leave-one-subject-out
   cross-validation results showed that combining both modalities produced
   higher accuracy than using ppg or thermal imaging only (ppg+thermal:
   78.33\%; ppg: 68.53\%; thermal: 58.82\%). the multimodal results are
   comparable to the state-of-the-art stress recognition methods that
   require long-term measurements. finally, we explored effects of
   different data labeling strategies on the sensitivity of our inference
   methods. our results showed the need for separation of and normalization
   between individual data.
   conclusions: the results demonstrate the feasibility of using
   smartphone-based imaging for instant stress detection. given that this
   approach does not need long-term measurements requiring attention and
   reduced mobility, we believe it is more suitable for mobile mental
   health care solutions in the wild.}},

   indoor channels) are too diverse and complex, the distance estimation
   strategy of range-based positioning techniques should adaptively change
   depending on the environment. in this paper, we study unsupervised
   learning techniques that efficiently do this without human intervention.
   as users simply move around an area of interest with mobile devices, the
   proposed method autonomously learns the characteristics of the
   surrounding environments and changes the ranging strategy accordingly.
   to this end, we use either model-based or neural network (nn)-based
   ranging modules for estimating the distance from neighboring anchor
   nodes, calculate the position of the devices using trilateration
   techniques, and define cost functions that indirectly evaluate the
   accuracy of the ranging module based on the trilateration results.
   moreover, by assigning a unique trainable variable to each device, the
   proposed method is also able to compensate for different characteristics
   between devices without ground truth data. the performance of the
   proposed method is verified with a real-time location tracking
   application using received signal strength (rss) measurements from
   conventional wi-fi access points (aps) or round trip time (rtt)
   measurements from aps that support the fine timing measurement (ftm)
   protocol. in cases where a model-based ranging module is used, the
   proposed method closely achieves the benchmark performance, which
   perfectly optimizes all the trainable variables on the test data. if nns
   are adopted in the ranging module, the proposed method even outperforms
   the benchmark and achieves an average positioning accuracy of up to
   2.397 m using rss measurements, and up to 1.547 m using rtt measurements

  abstract  = {{introduction: one of the greatest challenges in burn care is the
   estimation of a total burn surface area (tbsa). it is especially
   challenging and needs to take into account the growing proportions and
   the age of a paediatric patient. the aims of this study is to: (1)
   assess the reliability of the three modalities (lb, mb, and eb) in
   calculating the extent of burn injuries and fluid resuscitation, and (2)
   compare the features in terms of usability and efficacy.
   methods: participants were recruited from women's and children's
   hospital (wch), south australia's surgical and emergency department.
   participants were introduced to lb, mb and eb, and then commenced
   calculation of tbsa on two simulated paediatric (patient a: 12 months,
   patient b: 4 years) burns. the participants were categorized into three
   groups; (1) burns-naive, (2) burns-experienced, and (3) burns-expert.
   results: a total of 45 participants took part in this validation study:
   doctors (49\%), nurses (33\%), nursing students (11\%) and medical
   students (7\%). the burns-naive group demonstrated higher means in both
   patients and has greater variance, tbsa mean 28.8\%, range 14-40.5\% and
   mean 37.4\%, range 20-52.3\% in patient a and b respectively. two-way
   anova analysis shows a statistically significant interaction between the
   effects of level of experience and use of applications on estimation of
   tbsa in larger burns.
   conclusion: innovative software and mobile applications demonstrate a
   high potential as clinical adjuncts in achieving better health outcomes
   in any health care system. both mersey burns and e-burn reduced the risk
   of human error particularly from untrained or nonspecialised clinicians,
   however, e-burn proved to be more favourable in our study.
   technology-aided models are the future of burns assessment, and further
   studies are warranted to determine their impact on overall clinical
   outcome. (c) 2019 elsevier ltd and isbi. all rights reserved.}},

   the key to providing a good user experience is to minimize the response

   and low-cost platform for measuring the response time of a smartphone.
   smart consists of a normal 30-fps (frame per second) webcam and a

   on a smartphone screen and the gui operation shown in the mirror. it
   then adopts image processing techniques to analyze the latency of the

   prediction of daily activities by mining smartphone data. a significant
   activity is a predefined activity to be inferred, for example, waiting
   for a bus, having a meeting, working in office, taking a break in a
   coffee shop et al. in this framework, smartphone contextual information
   consists of local time, user state as well as user significant location.
   this contextual triad forms a contextual tuple at each time epoch. the
   activity inference engine is developed using the dynamic naive bayes
   classifier (dnbc) method, which extends a standard hidden markov model
   (hmm) to make real-time inference less expensive and to maximize the
   flexibility of the overall framework for adopting adaptive context tuple
   elements and significant activity states. as for significant activity
   prediction, the solution is designed to forecast upcoming user
   activities based on virtual contextual tuple observation generated by
   mining historical significant locations and user states. this is
   achieved in two steps: 1) build virtual contextual observations and
   maintain a context data file which continuously record the user's
   contextual information based on the naive bayes strategy, but in a real
   time algorithm; 2) use the dnbc method for activity prediction.
   the performance of the overall contextual thinking framework was
   evaluated at the campus of texas a\&m university corpus christi. a
   contextual thinking engine for user significant activity inference and
   prediction is developed based on the android platform. six significant
   activities were defined and tested by three different testers for a full
   week at tamucc campus using three different samsung smartphones.
   experiment results reveal that the activity inference process can reach
   an average accuracy level of 78\%. prediction accuracy is relatively
   poor due to limited data length and low time quantization level.}},

   and data integration along the whole care continuum. however, these
   interventions pose relatively new regulatory, organisational and
   technological challenges that limit appropriate evaluation. lung cancer
   app (lucapp) is a mobile application developed by researchers and
   clinicians to promote real-time monitoring and management of patients'
   symptoms. this protocol illustrates a clinical trial designed to
   evaluate the usability, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of lucapp
   versus standard of care.
   methods and analysis this is a 24-week two-arm non-blinded multicentre
   parallel randomised controlled trial. a total of 120 adult patients
   diagnosed with small or non-small cell lung cancer and eligible for
   pharmaceutical treatments will be allocated 1:1 to receiving either
   standard care or lucapp in addition to standard care at three oncology
   sites in northern italy. during the treatment period, lucapp allows
   daily monitoring and grading of a list of symptoms, which trigger alerts
   to the physicians in case predefined severity thresholds are met.
   patients will complete a baseline assessment and a set of valid and
   reliable patient-reported outcome measures every 3 +/- 1 weeks, and up
   to 24 weeks. the primary outcome is the change in the score of the trial
   outcome index in the functional assessment of cancer therapy (lung)
   questionnaire from baseline to 12 weeks. secondary outcomes are the lung
   cancer subscale, the euroqol 5d-5l questionnaire, the hospital anxiety
   and depression scale, the supportive care needs survey short form, the
   app usability questionnaire and the zarit burden interview for the main
   caregiver.
   ethics and dissemination the trial received ethical approval from the
   three clinical sites. trial results will be disseminated through
   peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.
   conclusions this trial makes a timely contribution to test a mobile
   application designed to improve the quality of life and delivery of care

   exploiting sensors (e.g., temperature, moisture, radiometers, cameras)
   and actuators (e.g., motorized windows, irrigators, tools to deploy
   chemical products) through a mobile app. this approach could improve

   great amount of sensitive and private information stored in tablets and
   smartphones they represent an interesting surface attack for malware
   developers. from the defensive side, the well-known weaknesses of the
   current anti-malware technologies do not permit only the detection of
   new obfuscated malicious payloads, but also of obfuscated malware (even
   with trivial obfuscation techniques applied with automatic morphing
   engines). in fact, a threat is recognized only if its signature is
   present in the anti-malware repository and typically the signature
   extraction consists in a time consuming task performed by security
   analysts. in this paper we propose a two-fold method aimed to (i) detect
   the belonging family of a mobile malicious application and (ii)
   collocate the application in the right position in the phylogenetic
   tree. we represent application system call traces in terms of automaton
   and, through the adoption of process mining, we extract temporal logic

   design: cross-sectional design.
   setting: national conference for people with limb loss.
   subjects: a total of 118 people with non-vascular cause of lower limb
   amputation participated. subjects had a mean age of 48 (13.7)years and
   were an average of 10years post amputation. of them, 54\% (n=64) of
   subjects were male.
   intervention: none.
   main measure: the component timed-up-and-go was administered using a
   mobile ipad application, generating a total time to complete the test
   and five component times capturing each subtask (sit to stand
   transitions, linear gait, turning) of the standard timed-up-and-go test.
   the outcome underwent test-retest reliability using intraclass
   correlation coefficients (iccs) and convergent validity analyses through
   correlation with self-report measures of balance and mobility.
   results: the component timed-up-and-go exhibited excellent test-retest
   reliability with iccs ranging from .98 to .86 for total and component
   times. evidence of discriminative validity resulted from significant
   differences in mean total times between people with transtibial (10.1
   (sd: +/- 2.3)) and transfemoral (12.76 (sd: +/- 5.1) amputation, as well
   as significant differences in all five component times (p<.05).
   convergent validity of the component timed-up-and-go was demonstrated

   multidisciplinary rehabilitation for low back pain, were recently
   published. it remains unclear whether the implementation of user
   feedback in an updated version of this app leads to desired effects in
   terms of increased app usage and clinical outcomes.
   objective: the aim is to elucidate the effect on user retention and
   clinical outcomes of an updated version of the kaia app where user
   feedback was included during development.
   methods: user feedback of the initial app versions (0.x) was collected
   in a quality management system and systematically analyzed to define
   requirements of a new version. for this study, the anonymized data of
   kaia users was analyzed retrospectively and users were grouped depending
   on the available version at the time of the sign-up (0.x vs 1.x). the
   effect on the duration of activity of users in the app, the number of
   completed exercises of each type, and user-reported pain levels were
   compared.
   results: overall, data of 1251 users fulfilled the inclusion criteria,
   of which 196 users signed up using version 0.x and 1055 users signed up
   with version 1.x. there were significant differences in the demographic
   parameters for both groups. a log-rank test showed no significant
   differences for the duration of activity in the app between groups
   (p=.31). users signing up during availability of the 1.x version
   completed significantly more exercises of each type in the app (physical
   exercises: 0.x mean 1.99, sd 1.61 units/week vs 1.x mean 3.15, sd 1.72
   units/week; p<.001; mindfulness exercises: 0.x mean 1.36, sd 1.43
   units/week vs 1.x mean 2.42, sd 1.82 units/week; p<.001; educational
   content: 0.x mean 1.51, sd 1.42 units/week vs 1.x mean 2.71, sd 1.89
   units/week; p<.001). this translated into a stronger decrease in
   user-reported pain levels in versions 1.x (f1,1233=7.084, p=.008).
   conclusions: despite the limitations of retrospective cohort studies,
   this study indicates that the implementation of systematically collected
   user feedback during development of updated versions can contribute to
   improvements in terms of frequency of use and potentially even clinical
   endpoints such as pain level. the clinical efficiency of the kaia app
   needs to be validated in prospective controlled trials to exclude bias.}},

   first provide a detailed empirical study of over 6,000 java exception
   stack traces we extracted from over 600 open source android projects.
   key insights from this study include common causes for system crashes,
   and common chains of wrappings between checked and unchecked exceptions.
   furthermore, we provide a survey with 71 developers involved in at least
   one of the projects analyzed. the results corroborate the stack trace
   findings, and indicate that developers are unaware of frequently
   occurring undocumented exception handling behavior. overall, the
   findings of our study call for tool support to help developers
   understand their own and third party exception handling and wrapping

   practice innovation: medivate is an ios smartphone application and cloud
   architecture for patients and providers to keep medication and vaccine
   lists accurate by providing a method and tool to easily exchange these
   data. medications are added directly to the app from the electronic
   health record (ehr) or by the patient manually. quick response (qr) code

   process involving patients and student pharmacists practicing in
   community settings was used to develop and refine functionality.
   practice description: adults with an iphone were approached for
   participation in the design and evaluation of medivate. its
   functionality and integration into clinical workflow at hospital
   discharge or vaccine administration in the community were determined.
   evaluation: in the community setting, interviews of pharmacists were
   conducted. in the hospital, metrics of study participation and
   experience with app deployment were determined.
   results: the app was deployed in the community for patients that
   received vaccinations. interviews provided insight into barriers and
   logistics for successful engagement. the app was integrated into
   hospital workflow and demonstrated interoperability with the inpatient
   ehr. thirteen patients were provided the app before discharge.
   engagement with the app was evident through medication list shares,
   education access, and changes to medication lists. patients noted strong
   agreement with usefulness of the app to learn more about the purposes
   and adverse effects of medications prescribed.
   conclusion: a mobile app to achieve medication and vaccine list

   objective: the aim of this study was to examine feasibility and validity

   weeks, corresponding to when antidepressant pharmacotherapy begins to
   show efficacy.
   methods: a total of 30 patients (aged 19-63 years; 19 women) with
   mild-to-moderate depression participated in the study. the new cognition
   kit app was delivered via the apple watch, providing a high-resolution
   touch screen display for task presentation and logging responses.
   cognition was assessed by the n-back task up to 3 times daily and
   depressed mood by 3 short questions once daily. adherence was defined as
   participants completing at least 1 assessment daily. selected tests
   sensitive to depression from the cambridge neuropsychological test
   automated battery and validated questionnaires of depression symptom
   severity were administered on 3 occasions (weeks 1, 3, and 6).
   exploratory analyses examined the relationship between mood and

   because many data stored on mobile device are synchronized with
   distributed data centers, the system availability is a critical
   attribute that requires investigation. mobile backend-as-a-service
   (mbaas) allows developers to link the backend of their applications to
   cloud storage, as well as providing device management and integration
   with social networking services. the openmobster platform offers a
   complete synchronization service for mobile applications, but its
   availability is an inherent critical issue, because one failure can
   result in losses for companies that use this environment. analytical
   models can be used to assess availability of this type of environment
   and perhaps mitigate downtimes. this paper proposes a hierarchical model
   to assess the availability of the mbaas openmobster platform focusing on
   two scenarios: the basic architecture and the automatic recovery
   process. the designed models were validated through testbed measurements
   by automatically injecting and repairing the infrastructure. taking into
   account the three layers: hardware, operating system, and the mbaas
   openmobster, we observed openmobster being the most critical service
   component. we have applied failover strategy on the java virtual

   power, speed and amplitude of the lower limbs movements, and
   specifically for the elderly, the vertical jump has been shown to be a
   good predictor of functional capacity and risk of falling. the use of a
   mobile application (app) which can measure the vertical jump (i. e.,
   iphone app my jump) has recently emerged as a simple, cheap and very
   practical tool for evaluation of jump ability. however, the validity of
   this tool for the elderly population has not been tested yet. the
   elderly usually perform very low jumps and therefore the signal-to-noise

   the aim of the current study was to verify the validity and reliability
   of the iphone app `` my jump{''} for the evaluation of countermovement
   jump (cmj) height within an elderly population.
   methods: after familiarization, 41 participants performed three cmjs
   assessed via a contact mat and the my jump app. the intraclass
   correlation coefficient (icc) was used to verify the relative
   reliability, while the coefficient of variation (cv\%) and the typical
   error of measurement (tem) were used to verify the absolute reliability.
   pearson's correlation coefficient was used to verify the strength of the
   relationship between methods (i. e., concurrent validity), a
   bland-altman plot to show their agreement, and the student's t-test to
   identify systematic bias between them. for reliability analyses, all
   jumps were considered (i. e., 123). all jumps (i. e., 123), the average
   height of each attempt (i. e., 41), and the highest jump, were
   considered for validity analyses.
   results: the cmj height of the highest jump was 10.78 +/- 5.23 cm with
   contact mat, and 10.87 +/- 5.32 with my jump app, with an identified
   systematic bias of 0.096 cm (p = 0.007). there was a nearly perfect

   very good agreement observed (0.3255 to -0.5177 cm, 0.2797 to -0.5594
   cm, and 0.3466 to -0.6264 cm, for highest jump height, average jump
   height, and all jump heights, respectively). the icc of the my jump app
   was 0.948, the tem was 1.150 cm, and the cv was 10.10\%.
   conclusion: our results suggest that the my jump app is a valid and
   reliable tool compared to the contact mat for evaluating vertical jump
   performance in the elderly. therefore, it allows a simple and practical
   assessment of lower limbs' power in this population. for the elderly, as
   well as for other populations with low jumping heights, the highest jump
   height and the average jump height could be used indistinctly.}},

   anomaly detector and alert generator. the data capture module collects
   the application level data, transport and network headers of the traffic
   that goes into the iot device. the anomaly detector module uses a
   signature based approach to detect threats. the proposed framework is
   tested on a testbed comprising of arduino boards with wiznet ethernet

   (ibs-d) experience abdominal cramping, bloating, pressure, and pain. due
   to an absence of clinical biomarkers for ibs-d severity, evaluation of
   clinical therapy benefits depends on valid and reliable symptom
   assessments. a patient-reported outcome (pro) instrument has been
   developed, comprising of two questionnaires - the ibs-d daily symptom
   diary and ibs-d symptom event log - suitable for clinical trials and
   real-world settings. this program aimed to support instrument conversion
   from pen-and-paper to electronic format.
   materials and methods: digital technology (android/ios) and a
   traditional mode of administration study in the target population were
   used to migrate or convert the validated pro ibs-d pen-and-paper measure
   to an electronic format. equivalence interviews, conducted in three
   waves, each had three parts: 1) conceptual equivalence testing between
   formats, 2) electronic-version report-history cognitive debriefing, and
   3) electronic version usability evaluation. after each interview wave,
   preliminary analyses were conducted and modifications made to the
   electronic version, before the next wave. final revisions were based on
   a full analysis of equivalence interviews. the final analysis evaluated
   subjects' ability to read, understand, and provide meaningful responses
   to the instruments across both formats. responses were classified
   according to conceptual equivalence between formats and mobile-format
   usability assessed with a questionnaire and open-ended probes.
   results: equivalence interviews (n=25) demonstrated conceptual
   equivalence between formats. mobile-application cognitive debriefing
   showed some subjects experienced difficulty with font/screen visibility
   and understanding or reading some report-history charts and summary
   screens. to address difficulties, minor revisions/modifications were
   made and landscape orientation and zoom-in/zoom-out features
   incorporated.
   conclusion: this study indicates that the two administration modes are
   conceptually equivalent. since both formats are conceptually equivalent,
   both are psychometrically reliable, as established in the pen-and-paper
   version. subjects found both mobile applications (android/ios) offered
   many advantages over the paper version, such as real-time assessment of

  abstract          = {{current mobile revolution is leading to an increase of wearable health
   devices development and consequently a growth in ambulatory monitoring
   area. these systems can be applied in ambulatory diseases management and
   diagnosis, personal health monitoring or sports performance enhancement,
   providing physiological and body-area ambiance data during daily normal
   activities. nowadays several devices in the market have this type of
   technology, being one of them the vitaljacket (r) (vj (r)), a product
   from biodevices, s.a. this device is a medical certified smart t-shirt
   with textile embedded electronics for ambulatory monitoring of
   electrocardiogram (ecg), heart rate (hr) and accelerometer (acc) data
   that is in the market since 2008.
   in this work we report the result of a university-company joint r\&d
   effort that aimed to propose a reference extension architecture - called
   vitallogger - for vj (r) wearable health device that enables sensors
   seamless ``plug-in{''} to the company product. as a proof of concept of
   this novel adaptable architecture, we jointly implemented a prototype
   that extends vj (r) technology to incorporate new sensing modules in a
   seamless way. both hardware and firmware were re-designed and extended
   to create a reference extension architecture, enabling easy integration
   of different sensing modules according to the user monitoring
   preference/scenario. besides the ecg module already incorporated in vj
   (r), a module with a blood oxygen saturation (spo2) sensor and an
   ambiance temperature and relative humidity sensor was developed and
   added to the extended prototype vitallogger. this prototype was
   successfully built and tested, showing excellent results.
   the vitallogger adaptable extension architecture has shown its
   scalability by enabling seamless ``plug-in{''} sensing modules thus
   creating the possibility of swift creations of new products with
   different sensors combinations to adapt to different monitoring
   scenarios.}},

  abstract             = {{background: given the global prevalence of insufficient physical
   activity (pa), effective interventions that attenuate age-related
   decline in pa levels are needed. mobile phone interventions that
   positively affect health (mhealth) show promise; however, their impact
   on pa levels and fitness in young people is unclear and little is known
   about what makes a good mhealth app.
   objective: the aim was to determine the effects of two commercially
   available smartphone apps (zombies, run and get running) on
   cardiorespiratory fitness and pa levels in insufficiently active healthy
   young people. a second aim was to identify the features of the app
   design that may contribute to improved fitness and pa levels.
   methods: apps for improving fitness (aimfit) was a 3-arm, parallel,
   randomized controlled trial conducted in auckland, new zealand.
   participants were recruited through advertisements in electronic mailing
   lists, local newspapers, flyers posted in community locations, and
   presentations at schools. eligible young people aged 14-17 years were
   allocated at random to 1 of 3 conditions: (1) use of an immersive app
   (zombies, run), (2) use of a nonimmersive app (get running), or (3)
   usual behavior (control). both smartphone apps consisted of a fully
   automated 8-week training program designed to improve fitness and
   ability to run 5 km; however, the immersive app featured a game-themed
   design and narrative. intention-to-treat analysis was performed using
   data collected face-to-face at baseline and 8 weeks, and all regression
   models were adjusted for baseline outcome value and gender. the primary
   outcome was cardiorespiratory fitness, objectively assessed as time to
   complete the 1-mile run/walk test at 8 weeks. secondary outcomes were pa
   levels (accelerometry and self-reported), enjoyment, psychological need
   satisfaction, self-efficacy, and acceptability and usability of the
   apps.
   results: a total of 51 participants were randomized to the immersive app
   intervention (n=17), nonimmersive app intervention (n=16), or the
   control group (n=18). the mean age of participants was 15.7 (sd 1.2)
   years; participants were mostly nz europeans (61\%, 31/51) and 57\%
   (29/51) were female. overall retention rate was 96\% (49/51). there was
   no significant intervention effect on the primary outcome using either
   of the apps. compared to the control, time to complete the fitness test
   was -28.4 seconds shorter (95\% ci -66.5 to 9.82, p=.20) for the
   immersive app group and -24.7 seconds (95\% ci -63.5 to 14.2, p=.32) for
   the nonimmersive app group. no significant intervention effects were
   found for secondary outcomes.
   conclusions: although apps have the ability to increase reach at a low
   cost, our pragmatic approach using readily available commercial apps as
   a stand-alone instrument did not have a significant effect on fitness.
   however, interest in future use of pa apps is promising and highlights a
   potentially important role of these tools in a multifaceted approach to
   increase fitness, promote pa, and consequently reduce the adverse health
   outcomes associated with insufficient activity.}},

   with respect to the high prevalence of ankle ligament injuries and
   patients' young age, optimizing treatment and rehabilitation is
   mandatory to prevent future complications such as chronic ankle
   instability or osteoarthritis.
   objective: in modern times, an increasing amount of smartphone usage in
   patient care is evident. studies investigating mobile health
   (mhealth)-based rehabilitation programs after ankle sprains are rare.
   the aim of this study was to expose any issues present in the
   development process of a medical app as well as associated risks and
   chances.
   methods: the development process of the ankle joint app was defined in
   chronological order using a protocol. the app's quality was evaluated
   using the (user) german mobile app rating scale (mars-g) by voluntary
   foot and ankle surgeons (n=20) and voluntary athletes (n=20).
   results: a multidisciplinary development team built a hybrid app with a
   corresponding backend structure. the app's content provides actual
   medical literature, training videos, and a log function. excellent
   interrater reliability (interrater reliability=0.92; 95\% ci 0.86-0.96)
   was obtained. the mean overall score for the ankle joint app was 4.4 (sd
   0.5). the mean subjective quality scores were 3.6 (surgeons: sd 0.7) and
   3.8 (athletes: sd 0.5). behavioral change had mean scores of 4.1

   conclusions: the data obtained demonstrate that mhealth-based
   rehabilitation programs might be a useful tool for patient education and
   collection of personal data. the achieved (user) mars-g scores support a
   high quality of the tested app. medical app development with an a priori

   paramedic practice to improve pain assessment of older adults with
   cognitive impairment.
   methods. we conducted usability testing with paramedic students and a

   paper-based algorithm from which the app was developed. the potential
   use for the app was discussed. usability testing focus groups were
   recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using a thematic approach.
   proposed recommendations were disseminated to the delphi panel that
   reviewed and confirmed them.
   results. twenty-four paramedic students from two uk ambulance services
   participated in the focus groups. usability of the app and its potential
   were viewed positively. four major themes were identified: 1) overall
   opinion of the app for use in paramedic services; 2) incorporating

   studies using novel mobile phone technologies can provide valuable

   understanding of environmental exposures.
   objective: the objective of this study was to assess the performance of
   one of the least expensive mobile phones on the market to track people's
   travel-activity pattern.
   methods: adults living and working in barcelona (72/162 bicycle
   commuters) carried simultaneously a mobile phone and a global
   positioning system (gps) tracker and filled in a travel-activity diary
   (tad) for 1 week (n=162). the calfit app for mobile phones was used to
   log participants' geographical location and physical activity. the
   geographical location data were assigned to different microenvironments
   (home, work or school, in transit, others) with a newly developed
   spatiotemporal map-matching algorithm. the tracking performance of the
   mobile phones was compared with that of the gps trackers using
   chi-square test and kruskal-wallis rank sum test. the minute agreement
   across all microenvironments between the tad and the algorithm was
   compared using the gwet agreement coefficient (ac1).
   results: the mobile phone acquired locations for 905 (29.2\%) more trips
   reported in travel diaries than the gps tracker (p9.001) and had a
   median accuracy of 25 m. subjects spent on average 57.9\%, 19.9\%,
   9.0\%, and 13.2\% of time at home, work, in transit, and other places,
   respectively, according to the tad and 57.5\%, 18.8\%, 11.6\%, and
   12.1\%, respectively, according to the map-matching algorithm. the
   overall minute agreement between both methods was high (ac1.811, 95\%
   ci.810-.812).
   conclusions: the use of mobile phones running the calfit app provides
   better information on which microenvironments people spend their time in
   than previous approaches based only on gps trackers. the improvements of
   mobile phone technology in microenvironment determination are because
   the mobile phones are faster at identifying first locations and capable
   of getting location in challenging environments thanks to the
   combination of assisted-gps technology and network positioning systems.
   moreover, collecting location information from mobile phones, which are
   already carried by individuals, allows monitoring more people with a
   cheaper and less burdensome method than deploying gps trackers.}},

   the linear relationship (r-2 = 0.998) between the (a(0) - a)/a(0) values
   and s2o32- concentrations from 0.2 mu m to 2.0 mu m indicates that the
   fabricated agnps-based colorimetric sensor can be employed for
   quantitative assay of s2o32-. colorimetric responses are also monitored
   using the built-in camera of a smartphone. the sensor shows a linear
   response to s2o32- in 0-20.0 mu m solutions under the optimized
   conditions and is thus more suitable for rapid on-site tests than other
   detection methods. a smartphone application (app) is downloaded under
   android or ios platforms to measure the rgb (red, green, blue) values of
   the colorimetric sensor after exposure to the analyte. following data
   processing, the rgb values are converted into concentration values by
   using preloaded calibration curves. confirmatory analysis indicates that
   the proposed s2o32- colorimetric sensor exhibits feasibility and
   sensitivity for s2o32- detection in real environmental samples.}},

   additional stress is induced due to parking hassles starting from
   finding an empty parking spot to relocating the car later. we propose a

   overcome their parking problems and at the same time, make managing a
   parking space easier and cost effective by automating the entire process
   right from pre-booking a parking slot to making the payment. since most
   of the parking spaces are equipped with cctv surveillance cameras, we
   intend to use them to detect the presence of cars and measure the
   availability of parking spots within a parking space using techniques
   like image processing and machine learning. in order to test the
   performance of the proposed system, a prototype of the system is built
   that mimics the working of an actual parking space excluding minute
   details. a prototype of the application is built that would aid the user
   in booking the slot and guide him/her back to the allocated parking
   slot. the proposed system is compared with the existing systems and the

  abstract       = {{background: hypertension is a lifestyle-induced chronic disease that
   threatens the lives of patients. control of hypertension requires
   patients to follow self-management regimes; unfortunately, however,
   patient compliance with hypertension self-management is low, especially
   in developing countries. improvement of patient compliance is premised
   on meeting patient needs. mobile health apps are becoming increasingly
   popular for self-management of chronic diseases. however, few mobile
   apps have been designed to meet patient needs for hypertension
   self-management.
   objective: the goal of this study was to develop a mobile health app to
   improve patient compliance with hypertension self-management and
   evaluate the effectiveness of the app in terms of patient compliance.
   methods: clustering methods based on questionnaire responses were used
   to group patients. qualitative interviews were conducted to identify the
   needs of different groups. in stage 2, several functional modules were
   designed to meet the needs of different groups based on the results from
   stage 1. in stage 3, prototypes of functional modules were designed and
   implemented as a real app. stage 4 was the deployment process, in which
   we conducted a pilot study to investigate patient compliance after using
   the app. patient compliance was calculated through the frequency with
   which they took blood pressure measurements. in addition, qualitative
   interviews were conducted to learn the underlying reasons for the
   compliance
   results: in stage 1, patients were divided into 3 groups based on 82
   valid questionnaire responses. eighteen patients from the different
   groups (7, 5, and 6 patients) were interviewed, and the needs of the
   groups were summarized as follows: improve self-management ability,
   enhance self-management motivation, and receive self-management support.
   in stages 2 and 3, 6 functional modules were designed and implemented
   based on specified needs, and the usability of the app was improved
   through usability tests. in stage 4, 143 patients were recruited to use
   different versions of the app for 2 months. results show that patient
   compliance improved as functional modules were added (p<.001) and was
   maintained at a high level (rate of 0.73). interview results from 32
   patients show that the design of the app met different needs; thus,
   patients were more compliant with it.
   conclusions: this study developed a mobile health app for hypertension
   self-management using the goal-directed design method. the app proved to
   be effective for improving patient compliance with hypertension
   self-management.}},

   physical activity and eat unhealthy foods, and the prevalence of
   overweight and obesity has increased, which poses a public health
   challenge. mobile apps play an important role in their daily lives,
   suggesting their potential to be used in health-promoting strategies.
   objective: this review aimed to explore how mobile apps can contribute
   to the promotion of healthy nutrition, physical activity, and prevention
   of overweight in adolescents and students. for the apps identified, the
   review describes the content, the theoretical mechanisms applied, and
   lessons learned.
   methods: the databases scopus, medline, embase, and psycinfo were
   searched for english-language publications from january 2009 to november
   2013. studies were included if ( 1) the primary component of the
   intervention involves an app; ( 2) the intervention targets healthy
   nutrition, or physical activity, or overweight prevention; and ( 3) the
   target group included adolescents or students ( aged 12-25 years).
   results: a total of 15 studies were included, which describe 12 unique
   apps. ten of these apps functioned as monitoring tools for assessing
   dietary intake or physical activity levels. the other apps used a
   web-based platform to challenge users to exercise and to allow users to
   list and photograph their problem foods. for 5 apps, the behavioral
   theory underpinning their development was clearly specified. frequently
   applied behavior change techniques are prompting self-monitoring of
   behavior and providing feedback on performance. apps can function
   self-contained, but most of them are used as part of therapy or to
   strengthen school programs. from the age of 10 years users may be
   capable of using apps. only 4 apps were developed specifically for
   adolescents. all apps were tested on a small scale and for a short
   period.
   conclusions: despite large potential and abundant usage by young people,
   limited research is available on apps and health promotion for
   adolescents. apps seem to be a promising health promotion strategy as a
   monitoring tool. apps can enable users to set targets, enhance
   self-monitoring, and increase awareness. three apps incorporated social
   features, making them ``social media,{''} but hardly any evidence
   appeared available about their potential.}},

  abstract       = {{background: panic disorder with and without agoraphobia (pd) is a common
   psychological disorder. internet-based interventions have the potential
   to offer highly scalable low-threshold evidence-based care to people
   suffering from pd. get.on panic is a newly developed internet-based
   intervention addressing symptoms of pd. in order to transfer the
   training into the daily life of the individuals, we integrated mobile
   components in the training and created a so-called hybrid online
   training. the development and beta-testing of such a training requires a
   novel interdisciplinary approach between it specialists and
   psychologists. from this point of view, we would like to share our
   experiences in this exploratory paper.
   methods: this initial feasibility study (n = 10) offers, on the one
   hand, a brief overview of the interdisciplinary development phase of the
   mobile application and on the other hand, provides first insights into
   the usage, usability and acceptance of this mobile application using
   qualitative interview data as well quantitative measures of 8 completing
   participants. for these reasons, we used a pre-posttest design without a
   control group. furthermore, we present initial clinical outcomes of the
   intervention on e.g. panic symptom severity, depressive symptoms as well
   additional anxiety measures. finally, we end with implications for
   further research in the relatively new field of mobile mental health.
   results: overall, usability, user satisfaction, motivational value and
   technology acceptance of the app were perceived as high. the usage of
   app components was diverse: the use of interoceptive exposure exercises
   and daily summaries on anxiety and mood was highest while using in-vivo
   exposure exercises and monitoring panic symptoms was perceived as
   difficult. furthermore, participants showed after the training less
   clinical symptoms as at baseline-assessment.
   discussion: the current feasibility study contributes to an in-depth
   understanding of the potential of mobile technology in e-mental health.
   overall, the get.on panic app appears to be an acceptable and
   motivational part of a cbt-based hybrid online training for pd that has
   the potential to promote training success. after some suggested
   adjustments have been made, the efficacy should be investigated in a
   randomized controlled trial.}},

  abstract       = {{background: falls are a major threat to the health and independence of
   seniors. regular physical activity (pa) can prevent 40\% of all fall
   injuries. the challenge is to motivate and support seniors to be
   physically active. persuasive systems can constitute valuable support
   for persons aiming at establishing and maintaining healthy habits.
   however, these systems need to support effective behavior change
   techniques (bcts) for increasing older adults' pa and meet the senior
   users' requirements and preferences. therefore, involving users as
   codesigners of new systems can be fruitful. prestudies of the user's
   experience with similar solutions can facilitate future user-centered
   design of novel persuasive systems.
   objective: the aim of this study was to investigate how seniors
   experience using activity monitors (ams) as support for pa in daily
   life. the addressed research questions are as follows: (1) what are the
   overall experiences of senior persons, of different age and balance
   function, in using wearable ams in daily life?; (2) which aspects did
   the users perceive relevant to make the measurements as meaningful and
   useful in the long-term perspective?; and (3) what needs and
   requirements did the users perceive as more relevant for the activity
   monitors to be useful in a long-term perspective?
   methods: this qualitative interview study included 8 community-dwelling
   older adults (median age: 83 years). the participants' experiences in
   using two commercial ams together with tablet-based apps for 9 days were
   investigated. activity diaries during the usage and interviews after the
   usage were exploited to gather user experience. comments in diaries were
   summarized, and interviews were analyzed by inductive content analysis.
   results: the users (n=8) perceived that, by using the ams, their
   awareness of own pa had increased. however, the ams' impact on the
   users' motivation for pa and activity behavior varied between
   participants. the diaries showed that self-estimated physical effort
   varied between participants and varied for each individual over time.
   additionally, participants reported different types of accomplished
   activities; talking walks was most frequently reported. to be
   meaningful, measurements need to provide the user with a reliable
   receipt of whether his or her current activity behavior is sufficient
   for reaching an activity goal. moreover, praise when reaching a goal was
   described as motivating feedback. to be useful, the devices must be easy
   to handle. in this study, the users perceived wearables as easy to
   handle, whereas tablets were perceived difficult to maneuver. users
   reported in the diaries that the devices had been functional 78\%
   (58/74) of the total test days.
   conclusions: activity monitors can be valuable for supporting seniors'
   pa. however, the potential of the solutions for a broader group of
   seniors can significantly be increased. areas of improvement include
   reliability, usability, and content supporting effective bcts with
   respect to increasing older adults' pa.}},

  abstract             = {{wifi-based indoor localization systems are popular due to the wifi
   ubiquity and availability in commodity smartphone devices for network
   communication. the majority of these systems focus on finding the user's
   2-d location in a single floor. however, this is of little value when
   the altitude of the user is unknown in any typical multi-story building.
   in this paper, we propose truestory: a system that can accurately and
   robustly identify the user's floor level using the building's wifi
   networks. truestory targets challenging environments where the access
   point (ap) density is not uniform and/or there are open areas that make
   the aps heard strongly in faraway floors. to handle these challenges,
   truestory employs a number of techniques including signal normalization,
   ap power equalization, and fusing various learners using a multilayer
   perceptron neural network. we present the design and implementation of
   truestory and evaluate its performance in three different testbeds. our
   evaluation shows that truestory can accurately identify the user's exact
   floor level up to 91.8\% of the time and within one floor error 99\% of
   the time. this improves the floor estimation accuracy over the
   state-of-the-art systems and reduces the high floor errors by more than
   23\%. in addition, we show that it has a robust performance for various
   challenging environments.}},

   most (91\%) used text entry and 33\% used digital images to help
   identify foods. only 65\% had integrated databases for estimating energy
   or nutrients. fewer than 50\% contained any features of customization

  abstract             = {{traffic light plays an important role in ensuring the safety of road
   users particularly at road intersections. therefore, it is crucial to
   make sure that the traffic light is operational as soon as possible when
   traffic lights become faulty. faulty traffic lights may cause
   inconvenience to motorists and put them in dangerous situations
   especially during peak hours. when traffic lights are faulty,
   authorities are notified by motorists who would call or send a text
   message to the number attached to the faulty traffic lights. there are
   two problems that were identified in this situation. firstly,
   authorities rely on the motorist to report on faulty traffic lights.
   thus, the response time of the authorities to react to the faulty
   traffic light is dependent on the length of time that a motorist
   responds to a faulty traffic light. secondly, motorist could have
   difficulties in describing the fault type and traffic light information
   due to language or lack of traffic signage. as a result, the traffic
   light maintenance personnel could have misunderstood the situation.
   short messaging service is costly. furthermore, the text from short
   messaging service are limited and unable to provide rich information to
   the authorities. this paper presents the development progress of a
   proposed traffic light failure notification system called trafficsys.
   trafficsys was developed using the waterfall development methodology.
   trafficsys system consists of a mobile application that is used by
   traffic light contractors and a desktop-based application that is used
   by traffic light technicians. trafficsys notifies faulty traffic lights
   to the users via email through push notification. the content of the
   email provides information to the users such as location of the faulty
   traffic light via google map and also the fault type. the design of
   trafficsys system is simple and minimal. thus, the results of the
   usability testing have indicated that trafficsys is an easy to use
   system and that the information provided by trafficsys is clear,
   understandable and well-organized.}},

   minimum spot radius of 175 mu m is detectable when using the developed
   app, with a tolerance of 15\%, corresponding to 0.25 \% of the area

   twenty years. this development work covers the full spectrum ranging
   from fundamental research in materials science, processing and
   engineering issues, such as cell and stack design and construction
   aiming at stationary and mobile applications, up to cell and stack
   testing and system modeling. the main focus at present is the
   improvement of long-term stability and reliability for cells and stacks.
   this contribution will present the concept developed in julich and the
   challenges and strategies involved in achieving better reliability here
   especially by the example of the problem of nickel reoxidation in the
   anode. operating conditions causing nickel reoxidation may result in
   irreversible microstructural changes and macroscopic expansion of the
   anode, potentially leading to catastrophic cell failure.}},

   objectives: first, to evaluate prediction models constructed from data
   using machine learning techniques and to select the best performing
   model. second, to compare predictions from the selected model with
   predictions from the pediatric respiratory assessment measure (pram)
   score, and predictions made by ed physicians.
   design: a two-phase study conducted in the ed of an academic pediatric
   hospital. in phase 1 data collected prospectively using paper forms was
   used to construct and evaluate five prediction models, and the best
   performing model was selected. in phase 2 data collected prospectively
   using a mobile system was used to compare the predictions of the
   selected prediction model with those from pram and ed physicians.
   measurements: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and
   accuracy in phase 1; accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and
   negative predictive values in phase 2.
   results: in phase 1 prediction models were derived from a data set of
   240 patients and evaluated using 10-fold cross validation. a naive bayes
   (nb) model demonstrated the best performance and it was selected for
   phase 2. evaluation in phase 2 was conducted on data from 82 patients.
   predictions made by the nb model were less accurate than the pram score
   and physicians (accuracy of 70.7\%, 73.2\% and 78.0\% respectively),
   however, according to mcnemar's test it is not possible to conclude that
   the differences between predictions are statistically significant.
   conclusion: both the pram score and the nb model were less accurate than
   physicians. the nb model can handle incomplete patient data and as such
   may complement the pram score. however, it requires further research to
   improve its accuracy.}},

  abstract  = {{mobile health (mhealth), or the use of mobile technology to improve
   health, is a rapidly expanding field. there have been a number of
   intervention studies based on mobile apps and most of these focused on
   specific medical issues. a majority of the available health apps are for
   health and wellness promotion and disease prevention for the general
   public. but the pace of traditional academic research is slow and less
   nimble relative to commercial app development resulting in huge lags in
   dissemination into commercial settings for public health. this paper
   assessed the content, usability and efficacy of the commercially
   launched digital healthcare platform developed by cmed health for the
   purpose of preventing major noncommunicable diseases in the rural
   communities of bangladesh. a combining approach of quantitative,
   qualitative and participant observation were used in this study
   following the principles and process of action research methodology. the
   study evaluated the cmed health app by content analysis, usability
   testing, health observational study, and efficacy testing. the view of
   the service receivers, service providers and health managers of the
   concerned organization was evaluated to test the feasibility. the
   quantitative data was collected using a semi-structured questionnaire
   from 393 service receivers and qualitative data was collected through
   key informant interview (kii) of key-informants of service providing
   team, senior staff members and village opinion leaders and focus group
   discussions (fgds) with the direct service providers and service
   receivers. the study analyzed quantitative health data generated from
   the service delivery during 6month piloting with the members of more
   than 7,000 households in 21 villages. the main reasons for accepting the
   cmed health app was showing the results instantly on the screen, instant
   advices and getting health services in a smart system within a short
   period of time. this also increased their trust on the health care
   providers and they were benefitted by the health records stored in the
   cloud of the user for their next visit to physicians and getting
   medicines. the people also mentioned about the suitability of the
   digital healthcare services for preventing diabetes and hypertension in

   following sports-related concussion. canesense (tm) is a recently
   developed mobile lower limb motion capture system and mobile application
   for movement assessment which provides an objective measure of postural
   stability. one of the components within canesense (tm) is the
   post-concussive excursion index (pcei), a measure of postural stability
   expressed as a percentage of symmetry between lower limbs.
   purpose: the purpose of this case series is to examine pre-and
   post-concussion differences using two separate measures, canesense (tm),
   and a known test, the balance error scoring system (bess), in division i
   collegiate football players.
   methods: a convenience sample of eight football players diagnosed with a
   concussion, were the subjects in this case series. all subjects
   underwent baseline testing prior to the start of pre-season camp
   consisting of the single limb stance (sls) test with canesense (tm) and
   the bess test. twenty-four to 72 hours following their concussion, sls
   with canesense (tm) test and the bess test, were administered. segmental
   excursions for the thigh and shank segments for each lower limb were
   combined into the post-concussion excursion profile (pcep), which
   represents each segment's maximum excursion in the medial-lateral and
   anterior-posterior direction. the pcei is a single metric generated to
   quantify differences within subjects by comparing the pcep value between
   lower limbs during sls where 100\% suggests absolute symmetry.
   results: the pcei value decreased significantly post-concussion (41.43
   +/- 15.53\% vs. 87.41 +/- 6.05\%, p < 0.001) demonstrating a 52.6\%
   decrease in inter-limb symmetry when compared to baseline values. there
   was an unanticipated 36.36\% improvement in composite bess performance
   post-concussion (10.5 +/- 4.87 errors vs. 16.5 +/- 8.49 errors, p =
   0.10).
   conclusions: differences in inter-limb postural stability were found in
   subjects post-concussion. by assessing postural stability in both lower
   limbs individually, using the pcei, impairments were detected that
   otherwise would have likely gone undiagnosed using the bess test alone.}},

   resulting in improved health outcomes, cost reduction, and minimization
   of waste. a lack of underlying theory in existing interventions may
   explain the limited success in sustaining behavior change. this paper
   describes the development of a theory and evidence-based complex
   intervention to improve adherence to oral antidiabetics in older people
   via a software prototype with an anthropomorphic virtual assistant.
   methods: the behavior change wheel (bcw) was used to develop a
   theoretical understanding of the change process, corresponding to the
   first phase of the medical research council framework for developing and
   evaluating complex interventions. at the bcw core is a model of human
   behavior (com-b), which posits that human behavior (b) results from the
   interaction between capabilities (c), opportunities (0), and motivation
   (m). literature-derived medication adherence determinants were mapped
   onto com-b components. then, intervention functions (ifs) were selected
   employing the apease criteria. finally, standardized behavior change
   techniques (bcts) were chosen based on their suitability and their
   effectiveness on medication adherence trials. the prototype was
   developed for android devices; its core was implemented in unity3d,
   using a female 3d virtual assistant, named vitoria.
   results: two com-b components were identified as main targets for
   behavior change-psychological capability and reflective motivation;
   these were linked with four ifs- education, persuasion, enablement, and
   environmental restructuring. eleven bcts were, in turn, linked with the
   ifs. an example of a bct is ``problem solving{''}; it requires users to
   pinpoint factors influencing non-adherence and subsequently offers
   strategies to achieve the desired behavior. bcts were operationalized
   into the dialogues with vitoria and into supplementary software
   features. vitoria communicates with users verbally and non-verbally,
   expressing emotions. input options consist of buttons or recording
   values, such as medication taken.
   conclusion: the present approach enabled us to derive the most
   appropriate bcts for our intervention. the use of an explicit bundle of
   bcts, often overlooked in interventions promoting medication adherence,
   is expected to maximize effectiveness and facilitates replication. the
   first prototype is being refined with users and health professionals'
   contributions. future work includes subjecting the prototype to
   usability tests and a feasibility trial.}},

   balance through direct measures of postural sway in a cost-effective,
   convenient and portable fashion. however, there is insufficient evidence
   for use in populations with neurologic conditions.
   objectives: 1) to determine the test-retest reliability of the sway
   balance (tm) mobile application in measuring postural sway in
   individuals with parkinson disease, 2) to examine the concurrent
   validity of sway balance (tm) with inertial measurement units and 3) to
   determine if sway balance (tm) scores can predict disease severity.
   methods: thirty subjects with early stage idiopathic parkinson disease
   completed three trials of two sway balance (tm) protocols while postural
   sway was simultaneously measured by two inertial measurement units and
   sway balance (tm), then repeated testing one week later.
   results: sway balance demonstrated high test-retest reliability for both
   protocols (icc = 0.72 and 0.92) and good to excellent inverse
   correlation with the inertial measurement units across both protocols
   (rho = -0.61- -0.92; p < 0.001). sway balance (tm) did not accurately
   predict disease severity.
   conclusion: sway balance (tm) demonstrates strong test-retest
   reliability and concurrent validity with measures from inertial

   acute liver failure (alf) is an ideal condition for use of a checklist.
   our aims were to develop a checklist for the management of alf in the
   intensive care unit (icu) and assess the usability of the checklist
   among multiple providers.
   methods
   the initial checklist was developed from published guidelines and expert
   opinion. the checklist underwent pilot testing at 11 academic liver
   transplant centers in the us and canada. an anonymous, written survey
   was used to assess the usability and quality of the checklist. written
   comments were used to improve the checklist following the pilot testing
   period.
   results
   we received 81 surveys involving the management of 116 patients during
   the pilot testing period. the overall quality of the checklist was
   judged to be above average to excellent by 94\% of users. on a 5-point
   likert scale, the majority of survey respondents agreed or agreed
   strongly with the following checklist characteristics: the checklist was
   easy to read (99\% agreed/agreed strongly), easy to use (97\%), items
   are categorized logically (98\%), time to complete the checklist did not
   interfere with delivery of appropriate and safe patient care (94\%) and
   was not excessively burdensome (92\%), the checklist allowed the user
   the freedom to use his or her clinical judgment (80\%), it is a useful
   tool in the management of acute liver failure (98\%). web-based and
   mobile apps were developed for use of the checklist at the point of
   care.
   conclusion
   the checklist for the management of alf in the icu was shown in this
   pilot study to be easy to use, helpful and accepted by a wide variety of
   practitioners at multiple sites in the us and canada.}},

   clinicians, multidisciplinary rounds, and handover procedures for 54 h
   to identify data needs, work flow, and existing cognitive aid use and
   limitations. a prototype was developed using an iterative participatory

   overviews of the icu showing clinician assignment, patient status, and
   respiratory support; patient vital signs; a photo-documentation option

   computer interaction (hci) design approaches - apple versus one informed
   by child users.
   background there are studies concerning the creation of graphical
   interfaces for kids, however, they do not involve them in the design
   process. on the other hand, operating systems such as apple or android
   impose their graphic guidelines designed only for a general outlook.
   methodology the research has a scope of exploratory nature, with a mixed
   approach. for the measurement of usability, tests were developed to
   determine the degree of efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction
   generated in two versions of the same game. children between six and
   eight years of age were targeted for this test.
   contribution this research compares two design guides to determine which
   one is better to develop games for children.
   findings this study concluded that the design guide elaborated by
   children allowed the building a more efficient, effective, and
   satisfactory game because the total usability percentage was 89.84\%.
   this percentage was much higher than that obtained using the generic
   apple guide, where the percentage of total usability obtained was
   78.72\%.
   recommendations for practitioners using design guides to develop games
   for children helps to increase the level of usability for them.
   recommendations for researchers these design guides can be used for
   other devices that have different operating systems as guidelines to
   develop games for children.
   impact on society the future generations of game developers that focus
   on games for children can take into account the following guidelines to
   create games that children will enjoy more.
   future research perform usability tests with users of different ages,
   for example children, adolescents, and adults. it is also suggested to
   take into account mobile devices with android operating system.}},

   through improved responsiveness and reduced energy footprint. a
   fundamental challenge in offloading is to distinguish situations where
   offloading is beneficial from those where it is counterproductive.
   currently, offloading decisions are predominantly based on profiling
   performed on individual devices. while significant gains have been shown
   in benchmarks, these gains rarely translate to real-world use due to the
   complexity of contexts and parameters that affect offloading. we
   contribute by proposing crowdsensed evidence traces as a novel mechanism
   for improving the performance of offloading systems. instead of limiting
   to profiling individual devices, crowdsensing enables characterizing
   execution contexts across a community of users, providing better
   generalisation and coverage of contexts. we demonstrate the feasibility
   of using crowdsensing to characterize offloading contexts through an
   analysis of two crowdsensing datasets. motivated by our results, we
   present the design and development of the emco toolkit and platform as a
   novel solution for computational offloading. experiments carried out on
   a testbed deployment in amazon ec2 ireland demonstrate that emco can
   consistently accelerate app execution while at the same time reduce
   energy footprint. we also demonstrate that emco provides better
   scalability than current cloud platforms, being able to serve a larger

   suffer from anxiety and stress derived from excessive use, which can
   lead to both health problems and worse academic performance. around 97\%
   of the interviewees use the application more than 10 times a day, and
   52.40\% recognize losing hours of sleep by having nightly whatsapp
   conversations. 50\% of the interviewees suffer from the syndrome of
   ``phantom vibration{''} and 37\% check their phone in case of not
   receiving messages or calls in a few hours. for 54.22\% and 59.04\%,
   reading or writing a whatsapp is their first and last daily activity,
   respectively.
   another indication of the addiction that young people suffer is that
   93.67\% find it annoying, more than two thirds feel stress when having
   to answer immediately and 53.89\% acknowledge that they would feel alone
   if they could not use it during a time.
   from the point of view of the educator, this dependence is worrisome,
   since it can directly affect reducing the concentration and therefore
   the performance of the students when supposing a clear source of
   distraction. it can also indirectly affect studies, as it generates
   stress and anxiety, which accentuate this decline in academic
   performance. comfort and gratuitousness encourage the educational use of
   whatsapp. most students use whatsapp for university-related issues and
   belongs to some group chat related to their studies and which is an
   application used by university students for academic aspects.}},

   dxa measured percentage total body fat, android, gynoid distribution and
   android/gynoid ratio; inhibition and working memory updating through

   test. first-order partial correlations between regional body fat and
   cognitive executive function were computed partialling out the effects

   effect of gender on the body fat-cognition relationship.
   results showed a differentiated pattern of fat-cognition relationship
   depending on fat localization and type of cognitive function.
   statistically significant relationships were observed between working
   memory updating and: android fat (r = -0.232; p = 0.042), gynoid fat (r
   = 0.333; p = 0.003) and android/gynoid ratio (r = -0.272; p = 0.017).
   separating genders, the only significant relationship was observed in
   females between working memory updating and gynoid fat (r = 0.280; p =
   0.045). in spite of gender differences in both working memory updating
   and gynoid body fat levels, moderation analysis did not show an effect
   of gender on the relationship between gynoid fat and working memory
   updating.
   results suggest a protective effect of gynoid body fat and a deleterious
   effect of android body fat. although excessive body fat increases the
   risk of developing cdv, metabolic and cognitive problems, maintaining a
   certain proportion of gynoid fat may help prevent cognitive decline,
   particularly in older women. guidelines for optimal body composition
   maintenance for the elderly should not target indiscriminate weight

  abstract       = {{with the rise of advanced and affordable sensors offering continuous
   monitoring of city infrastructure, cities are increasingly seeking to
   become more `smart' and are adopting data-driven approaches to help meet
   sustainability goals. in the area of building energy efficiency, closely
   coupled with this effort is the prevalence of building energy
   benchmarking policies, which require public disclosure of vast new
   quantities of building-level energy data at urban scales (i.e., open
   urban energy data). while existing research efforts have focused on the
   potential of this data to transform energy efficiency markets and
   investments in the real estate sector, little research has been
   dedicated to assessing this information's value to the general public.
   given that achieving energy reductions in the built environment will
   require not only energy efficiency investments, but also greater
   awareness, engagement, and action from ordinary citizens, we study the
   potential of open urban energy data in providing citizen benefits.
   energy-cyber-physical systems offer a pertinent framework to link data
   from the virtual world to citizens' physical reality in order to improve
   their understanding and decision making. adopting an
   energy-cyber-physical system perspective, we aim to connect open urban
   energy data to citizens through the development and evaluation of a
   novel community-scale energy feedback system. this mobile cyber-physical
   system transforms building-level electricity consumption and production
   data across georgia tech's campus into a mobile application consisting
   of three features: spatial feedback, energy supply feedback, and energy
   consumption feedback. augmented-reality visualization elements are
   integrated into the system, providing georgia tech community members a
   direct link between their experienced physical environment and data
   stored in the virtual world. applying a user-centered design approach,
   prospective users evaluate the system via thinking aloud sessions and
   user surveys to assess understandings and perceptions of open urban
   energy data for the georgia tech campus. the results contribute to
   literature seeking to create energy feedback systems at the
   community-scale and expand research investigating citizen reactions to
   and opinions of open urban energy data. this research is an integral
   step to further engagement and participation from the public to help
   achieve a sustainable and citizen-valued energy future.}},

   the potential to make remote control of physical systems feel more

   design of metaphors for interacting with a particular system poses an
   open-ended, creative design challenge that lacks a single-point
   solution. this paper explores what we refer to as a dominant metaphor
   for performing a teleoperation task via interaction with a mobile user
   interface. these dominant metaphors may be inspired from the physical
   nature of the system to give the user the most natural experience when
   using a mobile interface. our approach for choosing an appropriate
   metaphor of interaction is demonstrated with an experiment wherein
   participants are asked to use different interaction metaphors to control
   a ball and beam testbed. experimental data shows that the preferred
   metaphor of the participants is the dominant metaphor of interaction,

   initial steps toward developing an effective sitb treatment that can be
   easily delivered on a very large scale. method: we created a brief (1-2
   min), game-like app called therapeutic evaluative conditioning (tec),
   designed to increase aversion to sitbs and decrease aversion to the
   self. in 3 separate studies, we recruited participants with recent and
   severe histories of sitbs from web forums focused on self-injury and
   psychopathology (ns = 114, 131, and 163) and randomly assigned them to
   receive access to the mobile treatment tec app or a control app for 1
   month. we tested the effect of tec on the frequency of self-cutting,
   nonsuicidal self-injury more generally, suicide ideation, suicide plans,
   and suicidal behaviors. results: analyses showed that, compared with the
   control app, tec produced moderate reductions for all sitbs except
   suicide ideation. across studies, the largest and most consistent
   reductions were for self-cutting episodes (32\%-40\%), suicide plans
   (21\%-59\%), and suicidal behaviors (33\%-77\%). two of the 3 studies
   showed that tec impacted its intended treatment targets and that greater
   change in these targets was associated with greater sitb reductions. tec
   effects were not maintained at the 1-month posttreatment follow-up.
   conclusions: future versions of brief, mobile interventions like that
   tested here may have the potential to reduce sitbs and related behaviors
   on a large scale.}},

  abstract             = {{background: despite the growing number of mental health apps available
   for smartphones, the perceived usability of these apps from the
   perspectives of end users or health care experts has rarely been
   reported. this information is vital, particularly for self-guided
   mhealth interventions, as perceptions of navigability and quality of
   content are likely to impact participant engagement and treatment
   compliance.
   objective: the aim of this study was to conduct a usability evaluation
   of a personalized, self-guided, app-based intervention for depression.
   methods: participants were administered the system usability scale and
   open-ended questions as part of a semistructured interview. there were
   15 participants equally divided into 3 groups: (1) individuals with
   clinical depression who were the target audience for the app, (2) mental
   health professionals, and (3) researchers who specialize in the area of
   ehealth interventions and/or depression research.
   results: the end-user group rated the app highly, both in quantitative
   and qualitative assessments. the 2 expert groups highlighted the
   self-monitoring features and range of established psychological
   treatment options (such as behavioral activation and cognitive
   restructuring) but had concerns that the amount and layout of content
   may be difficult for end users to navigate in a self-directed fashion.
   the end-user data did not confirm these concerns.
   conclusions: encouraging participant engagement via self-monitoring and
   feedback, as well as personalized messaging, may be a viable way to
   maintain participation in self-guided interventions. further evaluation
   is necessary to determine whether levels of engagement with these
   features enhance treatment effects.}},

   presents a hybrid approach by combining genetic algorithm and simulated
   annealing. the placement algorithm took account of wirelength, pin
   locations of each block and aims to minimise the total routing resource

   in healthcare has been widely used to deliver detailed information like
   availability of health care facility, finding location, navigation and
   etc. however, in some places, the use of lbs in healthcare is limited
   because of lack of resources or information for getting timely
   information to users or patients who need health care services. the
   problem that can be detected is that the vital information needed by the
   patients or users such as the availability of health care facilities
   like pharmacy, hospital, clinic, blood bank, etc. has to be seamlessly
   reached. this work focus to solve the problem by creating a application
   for patients to get the information about nearest health care facilities
   by using any android based mobile phone. the proposed system uses
   composite algorithm. composite algorithm comprises of three algorithms
   namely, information retrieval r-tree (ir2) algorithm for filtering
   process, k-nearest neighbour (knn) query technique for path and distance
   verification and ahuja- dijkstras algorithm to find optimized path. the
   information have taken from the google web server (real time data) by
   using google api, we have collected more than 1000 data pertaining to
   healthcare facilities like longitude latitude, speciality, contact
   details and etc. this system was developed by android os. the algorithm
   running at this system was very efficient of about 20\% from the
   existing system. this work tries to focus on algorithm for lower

   the various users are represented according to mpeg-ud (mpeg user

   webid principles. on the server side, irrespective of their elementary
   types (text, image, video, 3d, ...), the medical data are aggregated

   represented into mpeg-4 bifs or html5 standards. this way, each type of
   content can be optimally encoded according to its particular constraints
   (semantic, medical practice, network conditions, etc.). the mobile
   device should ensure only the displaying of the content (inside an mpeg
   player or an html5 browser) and the capturing of the user interaction.
   the overall architecture is implemented and tested under the framework
   of the medusa european project, in partnership with medical
   institutions. the testbed considers a server emulated by a pc and
   heterogeneous user devices (tablets, smartphones, laptops) running under

  abstract  = {{purpose the paper aims to improve the radiation-proof capability of the
   self-designed mobile robot with a 7-dof manipulator, enabling the
   long-playing inspection and intervention under high-dose radiation
   environment. in this context, gamma-ray irradiation test for electronic
   components and specific hardness design have also been specifically
   presented and discussed. design/methodology/approach the study's
   hardness design mainly focuses on shielding protection, distance
   protection and time protection. irradiation test is first carried out to
   investigate irradiation resistance of each electronic module. then,
   modular deployment and shielding calculation are completed for the
   point-type nuclear accidents, respectively, to achieve a robust
   anti-radiation design scheme. finally, the field experiment is conducted
   to validate system effectiveness and good mobility, and operational
   practices are acquired for the realization of time protection. findings
   coupled with modular redeployment and shielding design, irradiation
   results illustrate the effectiveness of robotic anti-radiation design.
   meanwhile, experiences and reformed measures from the field exercise
   implement efficient operation and radiological time protection. research
   limitations/implications - considering the huge risks of high-dose
   source exposure, the radiation-resistance of the overall system cannot
   be verified in the field experiment. fortunately, irradiation test and
   modular shielding calculation are conducted as a minimal validation.
   practical implications - the proposed anti-radiation design methods and
   the irradiated results can be applied to many other nuclear vehicles and
   manipulators for the feasible multi-layer protection and excellent
   mobility. originality/value a nuclear intervention robot with specific
   hardness design is presented in detail in this paper. enlightened by the
   idea of shielding and distance protection, a large number of electronic
   modules with multiple types and structures are treated and compared in
   irradiation experiments, while modular redeployment and retrofitting are
   completed to reduce irradiated damages. to achieve the effect of time
   protection, mobility performance and operational practices are discussed
   and validated in the field experiment based on the mobile system.}},

   affected clinicians' decision making at the point of care.
   methods: three iterative steps were taken to evaluate the usefulness of
   pubmed4hh tools at the nih clinical center. first, feasibility testing
   was conducted using data collected from a librarian. next, usability
   testing was carried out by a postdoctoral research fellow shadowing
   clinicians during rounds for one month in the inpatient setting. then, a
   pilot study was conducted from february, 2016 to january, 2017, with
   clinicians using a mobile version of pubmed4hh. invitations were sent
   via e-mail lists to clinicians (physicians, physician assistants and
   nurse practitioners) along with periodic reminders. participants rated
   the usefulness of retrieved bottom-line summaries and abstracts and
   indicated their usefulness on a 7-point likert scale. they also
   indicated location of use (office, rounds, etc.).
   results: of the 166 responses collected in the feasibility phase, more
   than half of questions (57\%, n = 94) were answerable by both the
   librarian using various resources and by the postdoctoral research
   fellow using pubmed4hh. sixty-six questions were collected during
   usability testing. more than half of questions (60.6\%) were related to
   information about medication or treatment, while 21\% were questions
   regarding diagnosis, and 12\% were specific to disease entities. during
   the pilot study, participants reviewed 34 abstracts and 40 bottom-line
   summaries. the abstracts' usefulness mean scores were higher (95\% ci
   {[}6.12, 6.64) than the scores of the bottom-line summaries (95\% ci
   {[}5.25, 6.10]). the most frequent reason given was that it confirmed
   current or tentative diagnostic or treatment plan. the bottom-line
   summaries were used more in the office (793\%), and abstracts were used
   more at point of care (51.9\%).
   conclusions: clinicians reported that retrieving relevant health
   information from biomedical literature using the pubmed4hh was useful at
   the point of care and in the office.}},

   already support the provision of personalized tour recommendations to
   assist tourists in making feasible plans and visiting the most
   interesting pois within their available time. however, existing tourist
   tour planners only regard available attractions as sites lacking
   physical dimensions (i.e., pois are treated as `points'). this restricts
   the modeling of pois as attractions that may be entered/exited from a
   certain location (e.g., the main entrance). although this is adequate
   for scheduling visits at museums, galleries, small squares or parks with
   single entry points, it fails to capture practical properties of typical
   tourist visiting styles in urban destinations. tourists commonly
   appreciate strolling through pedestrian zones, market areas or urban
   areas of architectural, cultural and scenic value rather than only
   visiting sites of restricted access or taking the fastest route to move
   among city landmarks. herein, we introduce scenic athens, a
   context-aware mobile city guide for athens (greece) which provides
   personalized tour planning services to tourists. far beyond than just
   providing navigational aid, scenic athens derives near-optimal
   sequencing of pois along recommended tours, taking into account a

   requirement-gathering process to inform the design of a prototype for a
   platform that uses smartcard technology, database deployment, and mobile
   phone app development. key design decisions focused on usability,

   results: we successfully designed an integrated mhealth platform and
   deployed it in 4 health facilities across benue state, nigeria. we
   developed the vitira health platform to store test results of hiv, hbv,

  abstract       = {{background banana (musa spp.) is the most popular marketable fruit crop
   grown all over the world, and a dominant staple food in many developing
   countries. worldwide, banana production is affected by numerous diseases
   and pests. novel and rapid methods for the timely detection of pests and
   diseases will allow to surveil and develop control measures with greater
   efficiency. as deep convolutional neural networks (dcnn) and transfer
   learning has been successfully applied in various fields, it has freshly
   moved in the domain of just-in-time crop disease detection. the aim of
   this research is to develop an ai-based banana disease and pest
   detection system using a dcnn to support banana farmers. results large
   datasets of expert pre-screened banana disease and pest symptom/damage
   images were collected from various hotspots in africa and southern
   india. to build a detection model, we retrained three different
   convolutional neural network (cnn) architectures using a transfer
   learning approach. a total of six different models were developed from
   18 different classes (disease by plant parts) using images collected
   from different parts of the banana plant. our studies revealed resnet50
   and inceptionv2 based models performed better compared to mobilenetv1.
   these architectures represent the state-of-the-art results of banana
   diseases and pest detection with an accuracy of more than 90\% in most
   of the models tested. these experimental results were comparable with
   other state-of-the-art models found in the literature. with a future
   view to run these detection capabilities on a mobile device, we
   evaluated the performance of ssd (single shot detector) mobilenetv1.
   performance and validation metrics were also computed to measure the
   accuracy of different models in automated disease detection methods.
   conclusion our results showed that the dcnn was a robust and easily
   deployable strategy for digital banana disease and pest detection. using
   a pre-trained disease recognition model, we were able to perform deep
   transfer learning (dtl) to produce a network that can make accurate
   predictions. this significant high success rate makes the model a useful
   early disease and pest detection tool, and this research could be
   further extended to develop a fully automated mobile app to help
   millions of banana farmers in developing countries.}},

  abstract       = {{background: medication nonadherence in heart transplant recipients
   (htxr) is related to graft loss and death. mheart is a mobile app that
   uses electronic patient-reported outcome measures (eproms) to identify
   and manage medication nonadherence in the outpatient heart transplant
   (htx) population.
   objective: the study primarily aimed to validate mheart to measure
   medication nonadherence in early stage htxr by assessing the
   psychometric properties of eproms. the secondary aims were to (1)
   measure patient satisfaction with the mheart tool and its usability and
   (2) explore the impact of a theory-based treatment on medication
   nonadherence rates to determine its scalability to larger research.
   methods: a prospective study was conducted in the outpatient clinic of a
   tertiary hospital. all consecutive early stage htxr (<1.5 years from
   htx) were included. the eprom psychometric properties assessed were
   validity, reliability, responsiveness, interpretability, and burden.
   eproms comprised the 4-item morisky-green-levine questionnaire and an
   adapted version of the haynes-sackett questionnaire the simplified
   medication adherence questionnaire (smaq) was also applied on-site.
   three consecutive medication nonadherence assessments were performed by
   a transplant pharmacist. to improve medication nonadherence,
   theory-based interventions were delivered in a 1-month period. patient
   satisfaction was assessed by a semiquantitative web based survey at the
   end of the study.
   results: we included 31 early stage htxr (age: mean 54 years, sd 12
   years), and 71\% (22/31) of them were men. the htxr were taking a mean
   13 (sd 4; range 7-18) drugs per day. a total of 42\% (13/31) of patients
   were unaware of the consequences of medication nonadherence, and 39\%
   (12/31) of patients were nonadherent to immunosuppressive treatment. the
   content validity measure showed excellent levels of expert panel
   agreement for the haynes-sacket (14/14, 100\%) and morisky-green-levine
   (13/14, 93\%) questionnaires smaq and morisky-green-levine eproms showed
   similar measurement domains (convergent validity, phi=0.6, p<.001),
   which, as expected, differed from haynes-sackett eproms (divergent
   validity, phi=0.3, p=.12). reliability assessment revealed a very strong
   association between eprom and on-site proms (phi>0.7, p<.001).
   reproducibility was moderate (haynes-sackett kappa=0.6, p<.002) or poor
   (morisky-green-levine kappa=0.3, p=.11) because of unexpected improved
   medication adherence rates during the test-retest period. according to
   responsiveness, the theory-based multifaceted intervention program
   improved medication nonadherence by 16\% to 26\% (p<.05). a burden
   analysis showed that eproms could potentially overcome traditional
   on-site limitations (eg, automatic recording of eprom responses in the
   hospital information system). the mean score for overall patient
   satisfaction with the mheart approach was 9 (sd 2; score range: 0-10).
   all 100\% (29/29) of patients surveyed reported that they would
   recommend the mheart platform to other htxr.
   conclusions: eproms adhered to the quality standards and successfully
   identified medication nonadherence in the htx population, supporting
   their widespread use. the theory-based intervention program showed a
   promising improvement in medication adherence rates and produced
   excellent patient satisfaction and usability scores in htxr.}},

   nowadays, and, consequently, in the market, there are several gadgets
   that measure several body features. in addition, the mixed use between
   smartphones and wearables has motivated research like the current one.
   the main goal of this work is to reduce the amount of times that a
   certain smartband (sb) measures the heart rate (hr) in order to save
   energy in communications without significantly reducing the utility of
   the application. this work has used an sb sony 2 for measuring heart
   rate, fit api for storing data and android for managing data. the
   current approach has been assessed with data from hr sensors collected
   for more than three months. once all hr measures were collected, then
   the current approach detected hourly ranges whose heart rate were higher
   than normal. the hourly ranges allowed for estimating the time periods
   of weeks that the user could be at potential risk for measuring
   frequently in these (60 times per hour) ranges. out of these ranges, the
   measurement frequency was lower (six times per hour). if sb measures an
   unusual heart rate, the app warns the user so they are aware of the risk
   and can act accordingly. we analyzed two cases and we conclude that
   energy consumption was reduced in 83.57\% in communications when using
   training of several weeks. in addition, a prediction per day was made
   using data of 20 users. on average, tests obtained 63.04\% of accuracy

  abstract       = {{background: persistent or chronic pain is a common health problem among
   adolescents. thus, it is important that they receive evidence-based
   strategies for symptom management. icancope with pain is a mobile phone
   app designed to help adolescents cope with chronic pain. the app
   comprises 5 evidence-and theory-based features: (i) symptom trackers for
   pain, sleep, mood, physical function, and energy; (ii) goal setting to
   improve pain and function; (iii) a coping toolbox of pain
   self-management strategies; (iv) social support; and (v) age-appropriate
   pain education. the icancope with pain app is based on theory,
   identified health care needs, and current best practices for pain
   self-management.
   objective: the objectives of this study were to describe the translation
   and cultural adaptation of the app into the norwegian context and
   evaluate the app's usability using a phased approach.
   methods: phase 1 included translation and cultural adaptation of the app
   into the norwegian context. this process used an expert panel of
   researchers and target group representatives who were responsible for
   the linguistic quality assurance and assessment. in phases 2 and 3 the
   app's usability was tested. for phase 2, the assessments of usability
   and user experiences included observation, the think aloud method,
   audiovisual recordings, questionnaires, and individual interviews in a
   laboratory setting. for phase 3, the assessment of usability and user
   experience over a 2-week home-based test included questionnaires and
   individual end-user interviews. overall, app usability was determined
   based on ease of use, efficiency, and user satisfaction. qualitative
   data were analyzed using deductive content analysis. descriptive
   statistics were calculated for quantitative data.
   results: end users did not report any misunderstandings or discrepancies
   with the words or phrasing of the translated and culturally adapted app.
   participants in both the laboratory-and home-based usability tests found
   the app self-explanatory and reported that all 5 of its features were
   easy to use. all tasks were completed within the allocated time frame
   (ie, efficiency), with few errors. overall system usability scale scores
   were high, with average scores of 82 and 89 out of 100 from
   laboratory-and field-based tests, respectively. participants liked the
   idea of a social support function (feature iv), although qualitative and
   internet server data revealed that this feature was rarely used.
   conclusions: this study described the cultural and linguistic adaptation
   and usability testing of the norwegian version of the icancope with pain
   app. high user satisfaction, ease of use, efficiency, and only minor
   errors cumulatively indicated that no changes to the app were needed,
   with the exception of facilitating user interaction within the social
   support feature. the app will be used in an upcoming randomized
   controlled trial with a larger sample.}},

   mainly on self-reported survey and interview data. there is little
   information on adult t1d smbs, along with corresponding compensation
   techniques (cts), gathered in real-time.
   objective the article aims to use a patient-centered approach to design
   idecide, a smartphone application that gathers daily diabetes smbs and
   cts related to meal and alcohol intake and exercise in real-time, and
   contrast patients' actual behaviors against those self-reported with the
   app.
   methods two usability studies were used to improve idecide's
   functionality. these were followed by a 30-day pilot test of the
   redesigned app. a survey designed to capture diabetes smbs and cts was
   administered prior to the 30-day pilot test. survey results were
   compared against idecide logs.
   results usability studies revealed that participants desired advanced
   features for self-tracking meals and alcohol intake. thirteen
   participants recorded over 1,200 cts for carbohydrates during the 30-day
   study. participants also recorded 76 alcohol and 166 exercise cts.
   comparisons of survey responses and idecide logs showed mean\% (standard
   deviation) concordance of 77\% (25) for smbs related to meals, where
   concordance of 100\% indicates a perfect match. there was low
   concordance of 35\% (35) and 46\% (41) for alcohol and exercise events,
   respectively.
   conclusion the high variability found in smbs and cts highlights the
   need for real-time diabetes self-tracking mechanisms to better
   understand smbs and cts. future work will use the developed app to
   collect smbs and cts and identify patient-specific diabetes adherence

   results: there are clear differences in terms of how the mobile systems
   connected to the stationary pacs.web-based solutions allow the mobile
   image display systems to function independently of their operating
   systems. the examined systems differed very little in terms of image
   display and image analysis functions.
   conclusion: mobile image display systems complement stationary pacs and
   can be used to view images. the impacts of the new quality assurance
   guidelines (qs-rl) as well as the upcoming new standard din6868-157 on
   the acceptance testing of mobile image display units for the purpose of
   image evaluation are discussed.
   key points: center dot the examined mobile image display systems differ

   zusammenfassung
   ziel: mobile radiologische bildwiedergabesysteme finden eine zunehmende
   verbreitung. es sollten daher die eigenschaften einiger dieser systeme
   hinsichtlich des verwendeten betriebssystems, der anbindung an das
   stationare pacs, der datensicherheit und des funktionsumfangs der
   bilddarstellung und bildanalyse miteinander verglichen werden.
   material und methoden: mithilfe eines standardisierten fragebogens
   (erhebungszeitraum herbst 2013) wurden die technischen eigenschaften von
   18 mobilen radiologischen bildwiedergabesystemen bei 17 pacs-anbietern
   abgefragt. des weiteren wurde untersucht, inwieweit die technischen
   spezifikationen der mobilen bildwiedergabesysteme den vorgaben des
   medizinproduktegesetzes als auch den vorgaben der rontgenverordnung
   (rov) genugen.
   ergebnisse: hinsichtlich der art der softwareanbindung des mobilen
   systems an das stationare pacs fanden sich deutliche unterschiede.
   webbasierte systeme ermoglichen eine unabhangigkeit der mobilen
   bildwiedergabesysteme von dem eigenen betriebssystem. hinsichtlich der
   funktionen der bilddarstellung und bildanalyse waren die unterschiede
   zwischen den untersuchten systemen gering.
   schlussfolgerung: mobile bildwiedergabesysteme stellen eine erganzung zu
   stationaren pacs dar und sind fur die bildbetrachtung einsetzbar. die
   auswirkungen der neuen qualitatssicherungs-richtlinie (qs-rl) sowie der
   in kurze erwarteten neuen norm din6868-157 auf die abnahmeprufung der
   mobilen bildwiedergabegerate fur die bildbefundung werden diskutiert.}},

   to record more information of user inputs for accurate replaying without
   degrading user experience. in addition, an adaptive replay method is
   designed to enable replaying events on different devices with diverse

   currently meet the physical activity guidelines recommended by the us
   department of health and human services. with the rapid development of
   mobile technologies, mobile apps have the potential to improve
   participation rates in exercise programs, particularly if they are
   evidence-based and are of sufficient content quality.
   objective: the goal of this study was to develop and test an instrument,
   which was designed to score the content quality of exercise program apps
   with respect to the exercise guidelines set forth by the american
   college of sports medicine (acsm).
   methods: we conducted two focus groups (n=14) to elicit input for
   developing a preliminary 27-item scoring instruments based on the acsm
   exercise prescription guidelines. three reviewers who were no sports
   medicine experts independently scored 28 exercise program apps using the
   instrument. inter- and intra-rater reliability was assessed among the 3
   reviewers. an expert reviewer, a fellow of the acsm, also scored the 28
   apps to create criterion scores. criterion validity was assessed by
   comparing nonexpert reviewers' scores to the criterion scores.
   results: overall, inter-and intra-rater reliability was high with most
   coefficients being greater than .7. inter-rater reliability coefficients
   ranged from .59 to.99, and intra-rater reliability coefficients ranged
   from .47 to 1.00. all reliability coefficients were statistically
   significant. criterion validity was found to be excellent, with the
   weighted kappa statistics ranging from .67 to.99, indicating a
   substantial agreement between the scores of expert and nonexpert
   reviewers. finally, all apps scored poorly against the acsm exercise
   prescription guidelines. none of the apps received a score greater than
   35, out of a possible maximal score of 70.
   conclusions: we have developed and presented valid and reliable scoring
   instruments for exercise program apps. our instrument may be useful for
   consumers and health care providers who are looking for apps that
   provide safe, progressive general exercise programs for health and

   voltages (imposed by sub-micron cmos technologies), which is why precise
   low-impedance sub-bandgap references (below 1.2 v) that are independent
   of process, package stress, supply, load, and temperature are critical.
   however, improving dc accuracy by trimming requires test time (cost) in
   production and dynamic-element matching (dem) introduces switching
   noise. additionally, improving ac accuracy by rejecting supply ripple
   with cascodes increases headroom requirements and shunting coupled noise
   with series low-impedance buffers introduces temperature-sensitive
   offsets that degrade dc accuracy. this paper presents a prototyped 0-5
   ma, 890 mv, low-impedance, 0.6 mu m cmos reference with a trimless
   3-sigma unloaded dc accuracy of 0.84\% across -40 and 125 degrees c

   the design adopts a low-cost, noise-free, self-selecting survivor scheme
   to automatically select the best matching pair of devices among a bank
   of similar pairs during start-up (or power-on reset) and use them for

   years, in this paper two well-established and popular operating systems
   were considered for comparison and testing: android and ios. thus, two
   basic applications featuring the same functionality and complexity were
   developed to run natively on both platforms. applications were developed
   by using development languages and tools recommended for each operating
   system. this paper aims to highlight the differences between the two
   operating systems by analyzing core feature performance metrics for both
   functionally identical mobile applications developed for each platform.
   results obtained could be further used for guiding the optimization of

   cancer prevention programs aim to reduce sun exposure and increase sun
   protection behaviors. effectiveness is usually assessed through
   self-report.
   objective: it was the aim of this study to test the acceptance and
   validity of a newly developed ultraviolet radiation (uvr) exposure app,
   designed to reduce the data collection burden to research participants.
   physical activity data was collected because a strong focus on sun
   avoidance may result in unhealthy reductions in physical activity. this
   paper provides lessons learned from collecting data from participants
   using paper diaries, a mobile app, dosimeters, and accelerometers for
   measuring end-points of uvr exposure and physical activity.
   methods: two participant groups were recruited through social and
   traditional media campaigns 1) group a uvr diaries and 2) group b
   physical activity. in group a, nineteen participants wore an uvr
   dosimeter wristwatch (university of canterbury, new zealand) when
   outside for 7 days. they also recorded their sun exposure and physical
   activity levels using both 1) the uvr diary app and 2) a paper uvr
   diary. in group b, 55 participants wore an accelerometer (actigraph,
   pensacola, fl, usa) for 14 days and completed the uvr diary app. data
   from the uvr diary app were compared with uvr dosimeter wristwatch,
   accelerometer, and paper uvr diary data. cohen kappa coefficient score
   was used to determine if there was agreement between categorical
   variables for different uvr data collection methods and spearman rank
   correlation coefficient was used to determine agreement between
   continuous accelerometer data and app-collected self-report physical
   activity.
   results: the mean age of participants in groups a (n=19) and b (n=55)
   was 29.3 and 25.4 years, and 63\% (12/19) and 75\% (41/55) were females,
   respectively. self-reported sun exposure data in the uvr app correlated
   highly with uvr dosimetry (k=0.83, 95\% ci 0.64-1.00, p<.001).
   correlation between self-reported uvr app and accelerometer-collected
   moderate to vigorous physical activity data was low (p=0.23, p=.10),
   while agreement for low-intensity physical activity was significantly
   different (p=-0.49, p<.001). seventy-nine percent of participants
   preferred the app over the paper diary for daily self-report of uvr
   exposure and physical activity.
   conclusions: this feasibility study highlights self-report using an uvr
   app can reliably collect personal uvr exposure, but further improvements
   are required before the app can also be used to collect physical
   activity data.}},

  abstract  = {{with a combination of high performance and nonvolatility, the arrival of
   3d xpoint memory promises to fundamentally change the memory-storage
   hierarchy at the hardware, system software, and application levels. this
   memory will be deployed first as a block addressable storage device,
   known as the intel optane ssd, and even in this familiar form it will
   drive basic system change. access times consistently as fast, or faster,
   than the rest of the system will blur the line between storage and
   memory. the low latencies from these solid-state drives (ssds) allow
   rethinking even basic storage methodologies to be more memory-like. for
   example, the manner in which storage performance is measured shifts from
   input output operations (ios) at a given queue depth to response time
   for a given load, like memory is typically measured. system changes to
   match the low latency of these ssds are already advanced, and in many
   cases they enable the application to utilize the ssd's performance. in
   other cases, additional work is required, particularly on policies set
   originally with slow storage in mind. on top of these already-capable
   systems are real applications. system-level tests show that applications
   such as key value stores and real-time analytics can benefit
   immediately. these application benefits include significantly faster
   runtime (up to 3x) and access to larger data sets than supported in
   dram. newly viable mechanisms for expanding application memory footprint
   include native application support or native operating system paging, a
   significant change in the use of ssds. the next step in this convergence
   is 3d xpoint memory accessed through processor load/store operations.
   significant operating system support is already in place. the
   implications of consistently low latency storage and fast persistent
   memory on computing are great, with applications and systems taking
   advantage of this new technology as storage as the first to benefit.}},

   can be made to interact with the outdoor robots. android devices are
   ideal as they are open source and can be integrated with robots powered
   by the robot operating system (ros), also open source. however, due to
   the limits of rosjava, the mechanism that links ros with android, and
   the conflicting modes of operation between ros and android, current
   implementations of ros-android offer limited robot applications that do
   not support advanced operations such as autonomous navigation and

   these limitations, by combining ros with android through a number of ros
   and android bridges that would facilitate the development of advanced
   robot applications. through the proposed method, authors were able to
   develop a portable hri framework that allowed human operators to
   supervise an outdoor mobile robot while it performed an autonomous task.
   from their mobile devices, users were able to initialize the robot,
   configure its motion, and monitor its progress. also, users were able to
   reprogram the robot to perform new tasks (not previously planned)
   through a creative use of features offered in the developed hri

   android pie operating system (os). we propose line-of-sight (los)
   identification algorithms applicable to wifi ftm and apply these
   algorithms to indoor localization based on multilateration methods. we
   utilize a hypothesis test framework and support vector machine (svm) to
   identify los signals. we divide los/nlos signals as low and high-quality
   signals according to the degree of multipath error. we achieve
   high-quality signals identification rate of 92.4\% on average in the
   sample size 99 and of 78.3\% on average in the sample size 29.
   therefore, we obtain a 24.4\% localization performance improvement
   compared to the perfect los detector by using only high-quality signals
   to localization.}},

  abstract             = {{device-to-device (d2d) networks impose a significant challenge on
   delay-sensitive crowdsourcing due to the highly non-deterministic and
   intermittent network connectivity. under this setting, the paper
   investigates a participant recruitment problem in which an initial set
   of recruited nodes, which we call seeds, need to make an optimal
   decision on what other nodes to recruit to perform the crowdsourcing
   task. these seeds face the dilemma that recruiting more nodes increases
   their own payment but on the other hand also increases the risk of being
   excluded from the crowdsourcing task. as a first attack to this problem,
   we propose a dynamic programming algorithm. however, it is a centralized
   solution and hence the practicality is compromised. therefore, we
   introduce two distributed alternatives. one is based on the
   divide-and-conquer paradigm by first partitioning a network into a set
   of opportunistic voronoi cells and then running an optimization
   algorithm in each cell. the other is a task-splitting scheme which
   recursively delegates the recruitment task to newly joined nodes. we
   implemented our proposed solutions on an android-based prototype and
   built a testbed using 25 dell streak tablets. our experiments which
   lasted for 24 days demonstrate that the distributed schemes approximate
   the theoretical optimum with affordable complexity. moreover, we
   conducted simulations with a much larger scale and more diverse
   settings. the simulation results corroborate the experimental data and
   confirm that our proposed distributed solutions closely approach the
   performance of the centralized solution while satisfying the
   optimization goal under different network configurations.}},

  abstract     = {{mobile sensor devices have made a great leap in terms of popularity and
   proliferation amongst the public in recent years, being used for a wide
   variety of lifestyle, fitness and health applications. this makes them
   very attractive for scientists and users who are interested in the
   actual bio and environmental data these devices measure, what they are
   capable of and their limitations. however manufacturers like to limit
   access to such data, storing it on their own private servers, only
   giving customers access to the results of their often very specific and
   limited analyses. the underlying filtering methods, algorithms and
   training sets are virtually never disclosed. mobile sensor devices use
   various bluetooth-protocols like rfcomm and gatt to transfer data onto a
   smartphone or tablet. and there is the crux of the matter: hardly any of
   the manufacturers encrypt their connection, because that would take
   precious processing and battery power as well as more resources in
   development. this paper describes how to access raw bio-data on a
   selection of wearable and stationary sensor devices using nothing but a
   contemporary android-smartphone and a pc. a detailed example of how to
   access such a device is given. in empirical tests three out of four
   devices showed a total lack of effective security measures. from the
   combined experience of accessing several mobile sensor devices a
   generalized approach was formulated. finally a shortlist of simple
   methods that should prevent abusive exploits is given in the hope that
   future devices will show improved data security in particular for
   health-relevant applications that deal with sensitive information.}},

  abstract  = {{aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate the difference in maximum
   height loss values obtained from datasets based on optical profilometry
   and intraoral scanning. additionally, two analysis applications were
   tested with respect to their correspondence.
   materials and methods: to obtain baseline data, the occlusal surface of
   a metal phantom tooth was scanned by optical profilometry {[}wlp] and an
   intraoral scanner {[}ios]. then, wear was simulated at two locations of
   the tooth, three times each ({[}wear1], {[}wear2], and {[}wear3]), and
   the surface was captured after each status of wear, applying {[}wlp] and
   {[}ios]. the maximum vertical height loss was evaluated by comparing the
   3d datasets of {[}wlp] and {[}ios] at {[}wear1], {[}wear2], and
   {[}wear3] with the baseline data of {[}wlp] and {[}ios], respectively.
   for this purpose, two commercially available applications, geomagic
   qualify and oracheck, were used.
   results: apart from one outlier of 16\% difference between the data
   obtained from {[}wlp] and {[}ios], the maximum difference was 12.6\%,
   which was equal to a metrical value of 15 mu m. for the corresponding
   values, which were calculated with geomagic qualify and oracheck at
   identical wear facets, maximum differences between +7\% and -6.7\% were
   obtained.
   conclusions: according to this in vitro study, the wear measurement on
   the basis of {[}ios] seems to be a cost-effective, quick, and easily
   applicable tool for clinical screening purposes, with an acceptable
   reliability. with respect to the minor variations between each other,
   the geomagic qualify and oracheck measurement applications are
   equivalent.}},

   fat masses, as well as their association with muscle function, falls,
   and fractures were compared against conventional measures (hip/spine
   bone, appendicular lean, and gynoid/android fat masses). mid-thigh bone,
   lean, and fat masses showed strong correlation with conventional
   measures. mid-thigh lean mass showed similar associations with grip
   strength, gait speed, and timed up and go (tug) test as appendicular
   lean mass. appendicular, mid-thigh and mid-calf lean masses corrected
   for body mass index (bmi) showed stronger associations than when

   generated by apps running on mobile devices. usage data, such as average
   running time or number of active users of an app, is hard to be
   manipulated by untrusted developers, while different types of apps
   generate different usage patterns. based on this observation, we propose
   a new privacy-preserving categorization method of mobile apps based on
   learning patterns from a large scale of usage data. firstly, the usage
   data collected from different users is anonymized by shuffling. then we
   formalize the usage data as time series, extract and cluster usage data
   for each app based on dynamic time warping. we utilize the shape
   features to segment the clustered time series and transform them into
   feature vectors. finally, we adopt five machine learning methods to
   train and test the categorization models on 3,086 apps. the results show
   that svm performs the best. when we exclude apps with the small number
   of the usage data flows under 50,000, the categorization performance
   (f1-score) of our method is improved to be over 96\%, which is
   significantly better than the previous methods. (c) 2019 elsevier inc.

  abstract  = {{cognitive decline is a global healthcare problem. in this respect, we
   evaluate the feasibility and acceptance of an intervention with an
   application (app) that helps elderly to learn visual mnemonic techniques
   (vmt) that counteract cognitive impairment. a randomized, controlled
   pilot study was conducted with 14 subjects to gather information
   regarding users' perceptions of the app along with preliminary insight
   about the effects of the mnemonic training. our descriptive analysis of
   the results suggests that subjects exhibited a slight improvement on
   standard memory tests and a slight reduction in subjective cognitive
   decline. further research focusing on personal characteristics,
   environmental conditions, and task complexity is needed owing to the
   contribution of these factors to the inter-subject variations in in the
   use of the application and effectiveness of vmt. our study results
   suggest the importance of the development of a scale that quantifies
   relevant attributes and how much patients use vmt. 2019 the authors.

  abstract             = {{background: inadequate preoperative patient preparation causes
   organizational, economic, and emotional problems to patients and
   professionals. in spain, no current evidence is available on either the
   rate of compliance or the impact of good compliance with preoperative
   recommendations by patients in the ambulatory setting. however, it is
   known that around 25\% of surgical cancellations in the major ambulatory
   surgery (mas) are due to poor compliance with these recommendations and,
   therefore, avoidable. introducing innovative tools based on mobile
   health (mhealth) apps may help patients meet the preoperative
   recommendations and, consequently, reduce the rate of cancellations in
   the ambulatory setting.
   objective: the objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness
   of the listeo+ mhealth app as a tool for improving compliance with
   preoperative recommendations in mas versus standard of care (soc).
   methods: a multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial that
   compares soc with the additional use of listeo+, a specific mhealth app
   for mas preoperative patient monitoring, is being conducted. the study
   will include patients aged >= 18 years with surgical indication for mas
   who meet the necessary technological and connectivity requirements.
   patients in the control group will receive written preoperative
   recommendations, while those in the intervention group will additionally
   use the listeo+ mhealth app. there will be a competitive recruitment of
   790 patients during 6 months in 4 hospitals in andalusia (spain) that
   belong to the national health system. the primary efficacy outcome is
   the level of compliance with preoperative recommendations. secondary
   outcomes include the rate of cancellations, associated resource
   consumption, and perceived usability and utility with listeo+ by
   participants of the intervention group. simple randomization 1: 1
   procedure will be used to allocate patients to each study group.
   results: the technological development of listeo+ and the integration
   and interoperability of information systems was completed in september
   2017. subsequently, simulation tests were performed with listeo+, and a
   pilot study was initiated with real patients that concluded successfully
   in october 2017. patient recruitment began in december 2017 in the 4
   participating centers. after an intermediate analysis performed 10
   months after the start of the recruitment phase, the data collection and
   cleaning phases are estimated to be completed in april 2019, and the
   analysis with the final results will be conducted in july 2019.
   conclusions: progress in the integration and interoperability of
   information systems represents a major step forward in the field of
   mhealth. the app will allow health professionals to monitor in real-time
   patients' preparation and critical preoperative recommendations
   fulfillment. we expect a reduction in avoidable preoperative
   cancellations due to a lack of or a poor patient preparation.
   self-assessed web-based questionnaires and focus group will provide
   important information about the perceived usability and utility of
   listeo+ app among patients and health care professionals.}},

   cancer. interventions that address carers' needs and well-being have
   been developed and tested; however, the use of smartphone apps to
   support adult carers looking after another adult with cancer has not
   been assessed.
   objective: the objective of this study was to test the feasibility,
   usability, and acceptability of a smartphone app, called the carer guide
   app, for carers of people with colorectal cancer.
   methods: we recruited carers of people with colorectal cancer from
   outpatient day oncology units and provided them with access to the
   smartphone app for 30 days. carers had access to video instructions and
   email contact details for technical support. carers received 2 email
   messages per week that directed them to resources available within the
   app. carers completed demographic questions at baseline and questions
   related to feasibility and usability at 30 days post app download. we
   used recruitment and attrition rates to determine feasibility and
   relevance of content to carers' needs as self-reported by carers. we
   assessed usability through the ease of navigation and design and use of
   technical support or instructional videos. acceptability was measured
   through self-reported usage, usage statistics provided by google
   analytics, and comments for improvement.
   results: we recruited 31\% (26/85) eligible carers into the trial. of
   the 26 carers, the majority were female (19, 73\%), on average 57 years
   of age, were caring for a spouse with cancer (19, 73\%), and held a
   university degree (19, 73\%). regarding feasibility, carers perceived
   the content of the carer guide app as relevant to the information they
   were seeking. regarding usability, carers perceived the navigation and
   design of the app as easy to use. of the 26 carers, 4 (15\%) viewed the
   downloading and navigation video and 7 (27\%) used the contact email
   address for queries and comments. acceptability: on average, carers used
   the smartphone app for 22 minutes (sd 21 minutes) over the 30-day trial.
   of 26 participants, 19 completed a follow-up questionnaire of 19 carers,
   7 (37\%) logged on 3 to 4 times during the 30 days and 5 (26\%) logged
   on more than 5 times. the majority (16/19, 84\%) of carers stated that
   they would recommend the app be available for all carers. comments for
   improvement included individualized requests for specific content.
   conclusions: the carer guide app was feasible and usable among carers of
   people with colorectal cancer. acceptability can be improved through the
   inclusion of a variety of information and resources. a randomized
   controlled trial is required to assess the impact of the carer guide app

   aims and objectives. the purpose of this pilot study was to test the
   feasibility of an attention training application (ata) for
   community-dwelling older adults using mobile technology.
   design. a descriptive, mixed-methods design was used to capture older
   adults' feedback on the usability and acceptability of the ata.
   methods. a convenience sample of older adults (n = 9) from two
   independent living facilities participated in a 2-hour training and
   practice session with the ata. participants were given personally
   tailored instructions for using the mobile device and the ata
   specifically. following a practice session, participants provided
   ratings on multiple components of the ata and completed an
   audio-recorded, semi-structured interview to provide detailed
   descriptions of their experience and perceptions. an iterative process
   of content analysis was used to characterise the open-ended responses.
   results. participants rated the ata favourably overall on several 0-10
   scales including likeability {[}8.5 (1.6)], interest {[}8.8 (2.3)] and
   satisfaction {[}8.2 (1.9)]. the qualitative analyses revealed several

  abstract       = {{background: there has recently been exponential growth in the
   development and use of health apps on mobile phones. as with most mobile
   apps, however, the majority of users abandon them quickly and after
   minimal use. one of the most critical factors for the success of a
   health app is how to support users' commitment to their health. despite
   increased interest from researchers in mobile health, few studies have
   examined the measurement of user engagement with health apps.
   objective: user engagement is a multidimensional, complex phenomenon.
   the aim of this study was to understand the concept of user engagement
   and, in particular, to demonstrate the applicability of a user
   engagement scale (ues) to mobile health apps.
   methods: to determine the measurability of user engagement in a mobile
   health context, a ues was employed, which is a psychometric tool to
   measure user engagement with a digital system. this was adapted to ada,
   developed by ada health, an artificial intelligence-powered personalized
   health guide that helps people understand their health. a principal
   component analysis (pca) with varimax rotation was conducted on 30
   items. in addition, sum scores as means of each subscale were
   calculated.
   results: survey data from 73 ada users were analyzed. pca was determined
   to be suitable, as verified by the sampling adequacy of
   kaiser-meyer-olkin=0.858, a significant bartlett test of sphericity
   (chi(2)(300) =1127.1; p<.001), and communalities mostly within the 0.7
   range. although 5 items had to be removed because of low factor
   loadings, the results of the remaining 25 items revealed 4 attributes:
   perceived usability, aesthetic appeal, reward, and focused attention.
   ada users showed the highest engagement level with perceived usability,
   with a value of 294, followed by aesthetic appeal, reward, and focused
   attention.
   conclusions: although the ues was deployed in german and adapted to
   another digital domain, pca yielded consistent subscales and a 4-factor
   structure. this indicates that user engagement with health apps can be
   assessed with the german version of the ues. these results can benefit
   related mobile health app engagement research and may be of importance
   to marketers and app developers.}},

  abstract       = {{background: tuberculosis (tb) affects millions of people worldwide and
   is treated with medication including aminoglycosides and polypeptides.
   individuals respond differently to medications as a result of their
   genetic inheritance. these differences in genetic inheritance can result
   in the underdosing or overdosing of medication, which may affect the
   efficacy or, in the case of aminoglycosides and polypeptides used in the
   treatment of all forms of tb, result in ototoxicity. when ototoxicity is
   detected, physicians should adjust dosages to minimize further
   ototoxicity and hearing loss; however, there are no suitable grading
   systems to define significant hearing loss.
   objective: the aim of this study was to develop a standardized grading
   system by making use of an electronic health (ehealth) platform to
   ensure that a user-friendly method was available to interpret hearing
   test results, calculate significant hearing loss, and provide
   recommendations with regard to dosage adjustments and management. it
   further aimed to establish the sensitivity of the newly developed
   grading scale.
   methods: this grading system was developed in south africa based on data
   that were obtained from an audiology and pharmacokinetic study on
   patients with drug-resistant tb (dr-tb) at two dr-tb units at state-run
   hospitals. this feasibility study employed a prospective,
   cross-sectional, exploratory, descriptive case series research design,
   with a total of 22 participants. participants underwent audiological and
   pharmacological assessments at baseline and every 2 weeks for the first
   3 months of treatment. various professionals (8 in total) were
   subsequently involved in the development of the ehealth system,
   including a software engineer, four audiologists, a pharmacist, a
   medical doctor, and a nurse. the app underwent 14 modifications that
   involved aspects of data storage, ease of usability, grades, and the
   risk factor checklist.
   results: an ototoxicity grading system within a mobile app for use by
   doctors, nurses, and audiologists was developed for patients with dr-tb.
   the purpose of this user-friendly ototoxicity calculator, otocalc, is to
   (1) assist health professionals in assessing patients for ototoxicity,
   (2) establish the clinical significance of ototoxicity by calculating
   the grade of hearing loss, (3) monitor the progression of hearing loss,
   and (4) enable systematic referral and management of patients according
   to their needs.
   conclusions: this newly developed system is more sensitive than the
   existing grading methods for determining ototoxicity in patients with
   dr-tb. this app needs to be trialed in a larger sample to establish data
   security, ease of use, and suitability within this population.}},

  abstract  = {{introduction: following reports of respiratory symptoms among service
   members returning from deployment to south west asia (swa), an expert
   panel recommended pre-deployment spirometry be used to assess disease
   burden. unfortunately, testing with spirometry is high cost and
   time-consuming. the airflow perturbation device (apd) is a handheld
   monitor that rapidly measures respiratory resistance (apd-r-r) and has
   promising but limited clinical data. its speed and portability make it
   ideally suited for large volume pre-deployment screening. we conducted a
   pilot study to assess apd performance characteristics and develop
   normative values. materials and methods: we prospectively enrolled
   subjects and derived reference equations for the apd from those without
   respiratory symptoms, pulmonary disease, or tobacco exposure. apd
   testing was conducted by medical technicians who received a 10-min
   in-service on its use. a subset of subjects performed spirometry and
   impulse oscillometry (ios), administered by trained respiratory
   therapists. apd measures were compared with spirometry and ios. results:
   the total study population included 199 subjects (55.8\% males, body
   mass index 27.7 +/- 6.0 kg/m(2), age 49.9 +/- 18.7 yr). across the three
   apd trials, mean inspiratory (apd-r), expiratory (apd-r-e), and average
   (apd-r-avg) resistances were 3.30 +/- 1.0, 3.69 +/- 1.2, and 3.50 +/-
   1.1 cm h2o/l/s. reference equations were derived from 142 clinically
   normal volunteers. height, weight, and body mass index were
   independently associated with apd-r-i, apd-r-e, and apd-r-avg and were
   combined with age and gender in linear regression models. apd-r-i,
   apd-r-e, and apd-r-avg were significantly inversely correlated with fev1
   (r = -0.39 to -0.42), fvc (r = -0.37 to -0.40), and fef25-75 (r = -0.31
   to -0.35) and positively correlated with r5 (r = 0.61-0.62), r20 (r =
   0.50-0.52), x5 (r = -0.57 to -0.59), and fres (r = 0.42-0.43).
   bland-altman plots showed that the apd-r-r closely approximates ios when
   resistance is normal. conclusion: rapid testing was achieved with
   minimal training required, and reference equations were constructed.
   apd-r-r correlated moderately with ios and weakly with spirometry. more
   testing is required to determine whether the apd has value for pre- and
   post-deployment respiratory assessment.}},

   diabetes. it has been suggested that mhealth may be an important method
   for enhancing self-management when delivered in combination with health
   counseling.
   objective: the objective of this study was to test whether the use of a
   mobile phone-based self-management system used for 1 year, with or
   without telephone health counseling by a diabetes specialist nurse for
   the first 4 months, could improve glycated hemoglobin a(1c) (hba(1c))
   level, self-management, and health-related quality of life compared with
   usual care.
   methods: we conducted a 3-arm prospective randomized controlled trial
   involving 2 intervention groups and 1 control group. eligible
   participants were persons with type 2 diabetes with an hba1c level >=
   7.1\% (>= 54.1 mmol/mol) and aged >= 18 years. both intervention groups
   received the mobile phone-based self-management system few touch
   application (fta). the fta consisted of a blood glucose-measuring system
   with automatic wireless data transfer, diet manual, physical activity
   registration, and management of personal goals, all recorded and
   operated using a diabetes diary app on the mobile phone. in addition,
   one intervention group received health counseling based on behavior
   change theory and delivered by a diabetes specialist nurse for the first
   4 months after randomization. all groups received usual care by their
   general practitioner. the primary outcome was hba1c level. secondary
   outcomes were self-management (heiq), health-related quality of life
   (sf-36), depressive symptoms (ces-d), and lifestyle changes (dietary
   habits and physical activity). data were analyzed using univariate
   methods (t test, anova) and multivariate linear and logistic regression.
   results: a total of 151 participants were randomized: 51 to the fta
   group, 50 to the fta-health counseling (fta-hc) group, and 50 to the
   control group. follow-up data after 1 year were available for 120
   participants (79\%). hba(1c) level decreased in all groups, but did not
   differ between groups after 1 year. the mean change in the heiq domain
   skills and technique acquisition was significantly greater in the fta-hc
   group after adjusting for age, gender, and education (p=.04). other
   secondary outcomes did not differ between groups after 1 year. in the
   fta group, 39\% were substantial users of the app; 34\% of the fta-hc
   group were substantial users. those aged >= 63 years used the app more
   than their younger counterparts did ( or 2.7; 95\% ci 1.02-7.12;
   p=.045).
   conclusions: the change in hba(1c) level did not differ between groups
   after the 1-year intervention. secondary outcomes did not differ between
   groups except for an increase in the self-management domain of skill and
   technique acquisition in the fta-hc group. older participants used the
   app more than the younger participants did.}},

  abstract       = {{background: the prevalence of diabetes is increasing and with the
   requirements for self-management and risk of late complications, it
   remains a challenge for the individual and society. patients can benefit
   from support from health care personnel in their self-management, and
   the traditional communication between patients and health care personnel
   is changing. smartphones and apps offer a unique platform for
   communication, but apps with integrated health care personnel
   communication based on patient data are yet to be investigated to
   provide evidence of possible effects.
   objective: our goal was to systematically review studies that aimed to
   evaluate integrated communication within mobile apps for tailored
   feedback between patients with diabetes and health care personnel in
   terms of (1) study characteristics, (2) functions, (3) study outcomes,
   (4) effects, and (5) methodological quality.
   methods: a systematic literature search was conducted following our
   international prospective register of systematic reviews (prospero)
   protocol, searching for apps with integrated communication for persons
   with diabetes tested in a controlled trial in the period 2008 to 2016.
   we searched the databases pubmed, medical literature analysis and
   retrieval system online (medline), cumulative index to nursing and
   allied health literature (cinahl), cochrane central, excerpta medica
   database (embase), clinicaltrials. gov, and the world health
   organization (who) international clinical trials registry platform. the
   search was closed in september 2016. reference lists of primary articles
   and review papers were assessed. the preferred reporting items for
   systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma) guidelines were followed,
   and we applied the cochrane risk of bias tool to assess methodological
   quality.
   results: we identified 2822 citations and after duplicate removal, we
   assessed 1128 citations. a total of 6 papers were included in this
   systematic review, reporting on data from 431 persons participating in
   small trials of short duration. the integrated communication features
   were mostly individualized as written non-real-time feedback. the number
   of functions varied from 2 to 9, and blood glucose tracking was the most
   common. hba1c was the most common primary outcome, but the remaining
   reported outcomes were not standardized and comparable. because of both
   the heterogeneity of the included trials and the poor methodological
   quality of the studies, a meta-analysis was not possible. a
   statistically significant improvement in the primary measure of outcome
   was found in 3 of the 6 included studies, of which 2 were hba1c and 1
   was mean daytime ambulatory blood pressure. participants in the included
   trials reported positive usability or feasibility postintervention in 5
   out of 6 trials. the overall methodological quality of the trials was,
   however, scored as an uncertain risk of bias.
   conclusions: this systematic review highlights the need for more trials
   of higher methodological quality. few studies offer an integrated
   function for communication and feedback from health care personnel, and
   the research field represents an area of heterogeneity with few studies
   of highly rigorous methodological quality. this, in combination with a
   low number of participants and a short follow-up, is making it difficult
   to provide reliable evidence of effects for stakeholders.}},

   faculty attendings and residents were asked to participate in the study
   and were included. a web and mobile-based app, pulseqd, that allowed for
   collaborative learning was implemented. questionnaires were given at the
   beginning and end of the academic year. otolaryngology training exam

   embedded in the typical recommendation methods for online clothing. the
   test dataset is constructed with a real-world large-scale instance from
   one of the largest business-to-consumer e-commerce platforms () in
   china. considering the purchasing times and the inverse user frequency,
   three similarity measures are developed for the cosine-based similarity
   algorithm. various numerical experiments are conducted to analyze the
   recommendation methods and evaluate their performances by three
   criteria, namely precision, recall and diversity. because the test
   instance is large scale, the consumer-goods co-occurrence matrix is
   reduced to improve the computational performance considering most
   similar consumers. using this real-world instance, the algorithms are
   investigated under the evaluation criteria. the experimental results
   reveal that the recommendation based on user frequency similarity is
   very much suitable for the online clothing recommendation; the
   co-occurrence matrix reduction method is effective to improve the
   recommendation performance. to verify the proposed methods, the
   movielens dataset is used for comparison. the results show that the

   adoption of mobile devices (e. g., smart-phones, tablets, pads). in the
   market of mobile devices, a large portion were installed with google's
   android as the default operating system. a clear understanding of the
   android media framework is of great importance for the performance
   optimization of mobile video streaming. in this paper, we focus our
   attention on demystifying the magic of cache thresholds in the android
   media framework. as the key control parameters, cache thresholds play an
   important role in regulating the downloading behavior of a mobile
   device, which directly affects the cost and quality of mobile streaming.
   we built a dedicated testbed and conducted a measurement study to
   measure the cost and quality of mobile video streaming when varying
   cache thresholds. our measurements pointed out that, the sunk cost
   incurred by user viewing abortion will grow with the increase of either
   high or low threshold. more battery energy can be saved if lowering the
   low threshold. in addition, the freezing phenomenon can be mitigated
   significantly by increasing the low threshold. it is also interesting to
   observe that there exists a clear cost-quality tradeoff when varying
   cache thresholds. it implies that the current static cache management
   scheme is unsuitable to achieve the best cost-quality tradeoff. we
   finally discussed a few implications of our results on cache

  abstract       = {{background: the special supplemental nutrition program for women,
   infants, and children (wic) in the united states provides free
   supplemental food and nutrition education to low-income mothers and
   children under age 5 years. childhood obesity prevalence is higher among
   preschool children in the wic program compared to other children, and
   wic improves dietary quality among low-income children. the children
   eating well (chew) smartphone app was developed in english and spanish
   for wic-participating families with preschool-aged children as a
   home-based intervention to reinforce wic nutrition education and help
   prevent childhood obesity. objective: this paper describes the
   development and beta-testing of the chew smartphone app. the objective
   of beta-testing was to test the chew app prototype with target users,
   focusing on usage, usability, and perceived barriers and benefits of the
   app.
   methods: the goals of the chew app were to make the wic shopping
   experience easier, maximize wic benefit redemption, and improve parent
   snack feeding practices. the chew app prototype consisted of wic
   shopping tools, including a barcode scanner and calculator tools for the
   cash value voucher for purchasing fruits and vegetables, and nutrition
   education focused on healthy snacks and beverages, including a yummy
   snack gallery and healthy snacking tips. mothers of 63 black and
   hispanic wic-participating children ages 2 to 4 years tested the chew
   app prototype for 3 months and completed follow-up interviews.
   results: study participants testing the app for 3 months used the app on
   average once a week for approximately 4 and a half minutes per session,
   although substantial variation was observed. usage of specific features
   averaged at 1 to 2 times per month for shopping-related activities and 2
   to 4 times per month for the snack gallery. mothers classified as users
   rated the app's wic shopping tools relatively high on usability and
   benefits, although variation in scores and qualitative feedback
   highlighted several barriers that need to be addressed. the yummy snack
   gallery and healthy snacking tips scored higher on usability than
   benefits, suggesting that the nutrition education components may have
   been appealing but too limited in scope and exposure. qualitative
   feedback from mothers classified as non-users pointed to several
   important barriers that could preclude some wic participants from using
   the app at all.
   conclusions: the prototype study successfully demonstrated the
   feasibility of using the chew app prototype with mothers of wic-enrolled
   black and hispanic preschool-aged children, with moderate levels of app
   usage and moderate to high usability and benefits. future versions with
   enhanced shopping tools and expanded nutrition content should be
   implemented in wic clinics to evaluate adoption and behavioral outcomes.
   this study adds to the growing body of research focused on the
   application of technology-based interventions in the wic program to
   promote program retention and childhood obesity prevention.}},

   patients to audio-record medical consultations to improve recall,
   understanding, and health care self-management. novel health
   interventions such as secondears often fail to be implemented post
   pilot-testing owing to inadequate user experience (ux) assessment, a key
   component of a comprehensive implementation strategy.
   objective: this study aimed to pilot the secondears app within an active
   clinical setting to identify factors necessary for optimal
   implementation. objectives were to (1) investigate patient ux and
   acceptability, utility, and satisfaction with the secondears app, and
   (2) understand health professional perspectives on issues, solutions,
   and strategies for effective implementation of secondears.
   methods: a mixed methods implementation study was employed. patients
   were invited to test the app to record consultations with participating
   oncology health professionals. follow-up interviews were conducted with
   all participating patients (or carers) and health professionals,
   regarding uptake and extent of app use. responses to the mobile app
   rating scale (mars) were also collected. interviews were analyzed using
   interpretive descriptive methodology; all quantitative data were
   analyzed descriptively.
   results: a total of 24 patients used secondears to record consultations
   with 10 multidisciplinary health professionals. in all, 22 of these
   patients used secondears to listen to all or part of the recording,
   either alone or with family. all 100\% of patient participants reported
   in the mars that they would use secondears again and recommend it to
   others. a total of 3 themes were identified from the patient interviews
   relating to the ux of secondears: empowerment, facilitating support in
   cancer care, and usability. further, 5 themes were identified from the
   health professional interviews relating to implementation of secondears:
   changing hospital culture, mitigating medico-legal concerns, improving
   patient care, communication, and practical implementation solutions.
   conclusions: data collected during pilot testing regarding recording
   use, ux, and health professional and patient perspectives will be
   important for designing an effective implementation strategy for
   secondears. those testing the app found it useful and felt that it could
   facilitate the benefits of consultation recordings, along with providing
   patient empowerment and support. potential issues regarding

  abstract          = {{the study entitled ``development of mobile application for incident
   reporting{''} is an application that aimed to report and respond to an
   incident that may occur in the philippines community. the incident
   type's cover in the applications are the following: the ordinance
   violation, crime incident and public disturbance.
   aside from the philippine constitution, there are other laws that the
   citizen should know and follow. from the local government down to
   municipalities, the regulation called ordinance will pass to sanguniang
   panlalawigan, sanguniang bayan, and sanguniang bayan. the law is
   categorize into five namely: loyalty to the country, peace and order,
   stability and security of the family, health and physical well-being,
   and cleanliness, protection of the environment, and conservation of
   natural resources.
   the mobile application includes two main applications such as reporting
   and responder. however, both applications connected to the incident
   reporting website. the reporting application used by the victim or
   witness, to submit an incident report with photos that are then
   coordinated to either the nearest barangay or police station. while the
   responder application used by the barangay or police officials for
   notification and immediate response on the given report. it is capable
   of generating incident record form (irf), incident percentage and map
   plot summary report based on the accumulated reports from the reporter
   application. the application also supports a web admin to add a law
   enforcer to serve as responder and to generate statistical reports with
   chart and graphs of the reported and responded crime incidence.
   the initial data for the system is the report of crime incident given by
   the netizens, as victim or witness. using a mobile device, a netizen
   will access the application by downloading the application from play
   store then installed in their mobile devices. to use the application,
   the user needs to register for an account. in reporting application, the
   user should input the incident description, select the incident type,
   attach pictures of the incident and submit the report. the application
   will notify the nearest the barangay and allow to pass the report to the
   police station within the assign jurisdiction. all reports can submit to
   the nearest barangay units based on the location of the reported
   incident. the barangay or police personnel will notified of the reported
   incident for their immediate response. the assigned official or
   personnel can update the status of the report. once the reported
   incident is not scope of the barangay's jurisdiction, the report will
   transferred to the police officer or personnel. both barangay and police
   can also request for another backup, which will notify enforcer within
   the assign station or the emergency units such as fire station and
   hospital to respond. the investigator-on-case can also search and update
   the detailed information of the reported incident. the system can also
   produce the reports from the previous records via graphical like pie
   graph and plot map report. the website will produce the demographic
   count of the incident based on the specific area.
   the application runs in android phones with a 4.4 to 6.0 version and has
   an internet connection. moreover, the application was develop using

  abstract             = {{background: despite their increasing popularity, little is known about
   how users perceive mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet pcs in
   medical contexts. available studies are often restricted to evaluating
   the success of specific interventions and do not adequately cover the
   users' basic attitudes, for example, their expectations or concerns
   toward using mobile devices in medical settings.
   objective: the objective of the study was to obtain a comprehensive
   picture, both from the perspective of the patients, as well as the
   doctors, regarding the use and acceptance of mobile devices within
   medical contexts in general well as the perceived challenges when
   introducing the technology.
   methods: doctors working at hannover medical school (206/1151, response
   17.90\%), as well as patients being admitted to this facility (213/279,
   utilization 76.3\%) were surveyed about their acceptance and use of
   mobile devices in medical settings. regarding demographics, both samples
   were representative of the respective study population. gnu r (version
   3.1.1) was used for statistical testing. fisher's exact test, two-sided,
   alpha=.05 with monte carlo approximation, 2000 replicates, was applied
   to determine dependencies between two variables.
   results: the majority of participants already own mobile devices
   (doctors, 168/206, 81.6\%; patients, 110/213, 51.6\%). for doctors, use
   in a professional context does not depend on age (p=.66), professional
   experience (p=.80), or function (p=.34); gender was a factor (p=.009),
   and use was more common among male (61/135, 45.2\%) than female doctors
   (17/67, 25\%). a correlation between use of mobile devices and age
   (p=.001) as well as education (p=.002) was seen for patients. minor
   differences regarding how mobile devices are perceived in sensitive
   medical contexts mostly relate to data security, patients are more
   critical of the devices being used for storing and processing patient
   data; every fifth patient opposed this, but nevertheless, 4.8\% of
   doctors (10/206) use their devices for this purpose. both groups voiced
   only minor concerns about the credibility of the provided content or the
   technical reliability of the devices. while 8.3\% of the doctors
   (17/206) avoided use during patient contact because they thought
   patients might be unfamiliar with the devices, (25/213) 11.7\% of
   patients expressed concerns about the technology being too complicated
   to be used in a health context.
   conclusions: differences in how patients and doctors perceive the use of
   mobile devices can be attributed to age and level of education; these
   factors are often mentioned as contributors of the problems with
   (mobile) technologies. to fully realize the potential of mobile
   technologies in a health care context, the needs of both the elderly as
   well as those who are educationally disadvantaged need to be carefully
   addressed in all strategies relating to mobile technology in a health
   context.}},

  abstract       = {{background: in turkey, there are serious deficiencies in mental health
   care. although depression is highly prevalent, only a small number of
   people seek professional help. innovative solutions are needed to
   overcome this treatment gap. web-based problem-solving therapy (pst) is
   an intervention proven to be effective in the treatment of depression,
   although little is known about its clinical effects in turkey.
   objective: this study aims to test the clinical effects of a web and
   mobile app of an adapted pst for depressive symptoms among the general
   population in turkey.
   methods: participants will be recruited through announcements in social
   media and the middle east technical university. adults (18-55 years)
   with mild to moderate depressive symptoms (beck depression inventory-ii
   {[}bdi-ii] score between 10-29) will be included in the study.
   participants with a medium-to-high suicidal risk (according to the
   mini-international neuropsychiatric interview) will be excluded. a
   3-armed randomized controlled trial with a waiting control group will be
   utilized a sample size of 444 participants will be randomized across 3
   groups. the first experimental group will receive direct access to the
   web version of the intervention; the second experimental group will
   receive direct access to the mobile app of the intervention as well as
   automated supportive short message service text messages based on pst.
   the control group consists of a wait-list and will gain access to the
   intervention 4 months after the baseline. the intervention is based on
   an existing pst for the turkish population, her sey kontrol altmda
   (hska), consisting of 5 modules each with a duration of 1 week and is
   guided by a clinical psychologist. the primary outcome is change in
   depressive symptoms measured by the bdi-ii. secondary outcomes include
   symptoms of anxiety, stress, worry, self-efficacy, and quality of life.
   furthermore, satisfaction with, usability and acceptability of the
   intervention are important features that will be evaluated. all outcomes
   will take place online through self-assessment at posttest (6-8 weeks
   after baseline) and at follow-up (4 months after baseline).
   results: we will recruit a total of 444 participants with mild to
   moderate depressive symptoms from march 2018 to february 2019 or until
   the recruitment is complete. we expect the final trial results to be
   available by the end of may 2019. this trial is funded by the scientific
   and technological research council of turkey (national postdoctoral
   research fellowship programme 2016/1).
   conclusions: results from this study will reveal more information about
   the clinical effects of hska as well as its applicability in a turkish
   setting through the web and mobile platforms. on the basis of the
   results, a guided web- and mobile-based pst intervention might become an
   appropriate alternative for treating mild to moderate depressive
   symptoms.}},

   middleware oas uses adaptive vm allocation and deallocation algorithms
   based on a cpu rate prediction model. furthermore, it dynamically
   schedules the requests using a load-balancing algorithm to ensure
   meeting qos requirements at a lower cost. the authors have tested the
   proposed algorithm by conducting multiple simulations and compared our
   results with state-of-the-art algorithms based on various performance
   metrics under multiple load conditions. the results show that oas
   achieves better response time with a minimum number of vms and reduces
   50\% of the cost compared to existing approaches.}},

  abstract      = {{proton exchange membrane fuel cell (pemfc) is regarded as a potential
   future power technology for stationary and mobile applications due to
   its high efficiency (full and partial load), rapid start-up, high power
   density, and low emissions.
   depending on their particular application field (decentralized combined
   heat and power production, uninterrupted power supplies (ups), or mobile
   applications) different operating conditions and designing parameters
   are required and different performance can be expected.
   thus, the aim of this paper is to investigate the behavior and
   performance of two stacks of the same size, developed with a different
   approach according to their application sectors.
   the first pemfc stack is designed for ups units or mobile purpose, the
   second one, is designed to supply heat and power in residential
   applications (chp units).
   the analysis of the stacks behavior has been carried out by using both
   experimental and numerical investigations.
   experimental results have allowed: (i) to characterize the stacks; (ii)
   to calibrate the numerical model; (iii) to supply useful data for
   setting and improving the control system.
   numerical results have shown a good matching with the experimental data,
   so that the model seems to be a useful tool to predict the pemfc stack
   performance under several working conditions.}},

   excavation method which eventually results in meliorate caries-free
   cavity preparation for restoration. the objective of this study is to
   predict the post-streptococcus mutans prior to dental caries excavation
   based on pre- streptococcus mutans using ios app developed on artificial
   neural network (ann) model.
   methods: for the current research work, children with occlusal dentinal
   caries lesion were chosen, 45 primary molar teeth cases were studied.
   caries excavation was done with carbide bur, polymer bur and spoon
   excavator. the colony forming units for pre and post-streptococcus
   mutans were recorded, data emanating from clinical trials was employed
   to develop the ann models. ann models were trained, validated and tested
   with the registered clinical data using different ann architectures.
   results: feedforward backpropagation ann model with an architecture of
   4-5-1, predicts post-streptococcus mutans with an efficiency of 0.99033,
   mean squared error and mean absolute percentage error for testing cases
   were 0.2341 and 4.967 respectively.
   conclusions: caries excavation methods and pre-streptococcus mutans are
   feed as inputs, while post-streptococcus mutans as targets to develop
   ann model. based on the developed ann model, an ingenious ios app was
   developed, the global clinician may utilize the app to meticulously
   predict post-streptococcus mutans on iphone based on pre-streptococcus
   mutans, which in turn aids in decision making for the selection of
   caries excavation method. this study manifests the potential application
   of ios app with built-in ann model in efficiently predicting the

  abstract      = {{automobiles of the current era are heavily computerized which makes them
   highly susceptible to attacks that were unheard of with traditional
   automobiles. in the past with traditional automobiles, one would require
   physical access to the automobile to compromise it. today however,
   computerization has allowed remote accessibility of automobiles. remote
   compromise is feasible by utilizing a vast range of attack vectors such
   as mechanics tools, automotive infotainment system, bluetooth and
   cellular radios etc. in addition, wireless communication channels have
   made it possible to have long distance vehicle control, location
   tracking, in-cabin audio ex filtration etc. one of the electronic
   components in a modern automobile is its automotive infotainment system.
   this paper focuses on identifying the vulnerabilities of the automotive
   infotainment system with respect to its wifi capabilities by conducting
   structured vulnerability tests on the wifi capabilities of an automotive
   infotainment system. to do this, we analysed the wifi attack surface and
   constructed test environments and used appropriate tools such as (nmap
   (open port scan), nessus (vulnerability scan), metasploit) to generate a
   penetration testing plan to search for vulnerabilities. the
   vulnerability findings are well documented in this paper.}},

   frequency reuse in cellular radiocommunication systems, where the main
   aim is to obtain a channel assignment free of interferences such that
   the resulting bandwidth is close to the minimum theoretical channel span
   required. specifically, a genetic algorithm (ga) whose probabilities of
   mutation and crossover are on-line adjusted based on the diversity of
   the population is presented. this diversity is estimated by means of
   analyzing the individuals' fitness entropy. the resulting algorithm
   obtains accurate solutions, thus offering an interesting alternative to
   other global search techniques, such as simulated annealing, tabu search
   and neural networks, as well as to standard gas. a complete selection of
   the most well-known benchmark instances has been used in order to
   evaluate the performance of the proposed procedure. numerical
   simulations show that optimal bandwidth solutions are achieved within a
   reasonable computation time for all the problem instances tested. (c)

   we address the aging level of semiconductor components by describing the

   predict the remaining life, and control the device performance under

   flip-flop (ff) that can be used for these and other applications as
   well. moreover, we can control the operation of the proposed ff by
   controlling its clock and control signals. we demonstrate an application
   of the proposed ff for aging-monitoring, showing that, by halting the

  abstract       = {{background: autism spectrum disorder (asd) is a developmental disorder
   characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction, and
   restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests. the incidence of asd
   has increased in recent years; it is now estimated that approximately 1
   in 40 children in the united states are affected. due in part to
   increasing prevalence, access to treatment has become constrained. hope
   lies in mobile solutions that provide therapy through artificial
   intelligence (ai) approaches, including facial and emotion detection ai
   models developed by mainstream cloud providers, available directly to
   consumers. however, these solutions may not be sufficiently trained for
   use in pediatric populations.
   objective: emotion classifiers available off-the-shelf to the general
   public through microsoft, amazon, google, and sighthound are well-suited
   to the pediatric population, and could be used for developing mobile
   therapies targeting aspects of social communication and interaction,
   perhaps accelerating innovation in this space. this study aimed to test
   these classifiers directly with image data from children with
   parent-reported asd recruited through crowdsourcing.
   methods: we used a mobile game called guess what? that challenges a
   child to act out a series of prompts displayed on the screen of the
   smartphone held on the forehead of his or her care provider. the game is
   intended to be a fun and engaging way for the child and parent to
   interact socially, for example, the parent attempting to guess what
   emotion the child is acting out (eg, surprised, scared, or disgusted).
   during a 90-second game session, as many as 50 prompts are shown while
   the child acts, and the video records the actions and expressions of the
   child. due in part to the fun nature of the game, it is a viable way to
   remotely engage pediatric populations, including the autism population
   through crowdsourcing. we recruited 21 children with asd to play the
   game and gathered 2602 emotive frames following their game sessions.
   these data were used to evaluate the accuracy and performance of four
   state-of-the-art facial emotion classifiers to develop an understanding
   of the feasibility of these platforms for pediatric research.
   results: all classifiers performed poorly for every evaluated emotion
   except happy. none of the classifiers correctly labeled over 60.18\%
   (1566/2602) of the evaluated frames. moreover, none of the classifiers
   correctly identified more than 11\% (6/51) of the angry frames and 14\%
   (10/69) of the disgust frames.
   conclusions: the findings suggest that commercial emotion classifiers
   may be insufficiently trained for use in digital approaches to autism
   treatment and treatment tracking. secure, privacy-preserving methods to
   increase labeled training data are needed to boost the models'
   performance before they can be used in ai-enabled approaches to social
   therapy of the kind that is common in autism treatments.}},

   methods: a non-language-restricted search was performed using forced
   oscillation technique and impulse oscillometry as primary terms.
   original research studies reporting respiratory system impedance
   reference values or prediction equations based on cohorts of >= 100
   healthy adults were included. publications cited in identified studies
   were also considered for inclusion.
   results: of 882 publications identified, 34 studies were included: 14
   studies of fot, 19 studies of ios, and one study of both techniques.
   nineteen studies provided prediction equations. most reports were from
   europe ( n=20) and asia ( n=12) and included relatively small cohorts (
   median=264 subjects). across publications, there was marked variability
   in performance and technique of impedance measurements. height and sex
   emerged as major contributors to available prediction equations. the
   contribution of weight was more pronounced at the obese end of the
   weight spectrum. the contribution of age was less clear, and elderly
   were largely under-represented. ethnicity likely plays a role, but was
   under-reported in currently available literature. inclusion of current
   and former smokers in some studies further confound the results.
   conclusions: currently available literature providing reference values
   and prediction equations for respiratory impedance measurements in
   adults is limited. until larger-scale standardized studies are
   available, the choice of prediction equations should be based on
   datasets that best represent the target patient population and modality

   in those who are frequently involved in extended working hours and shift
   work which is found to be more common among nurses. cognitive impairment
   leads to fatigability, decline in attention and efficiency in their
   workplace which puts their health and patients' health at risk.
   aim: to find out the prevalence of sleep deprivation and its impact on
   cognition among shift working nurses.
   materials and methods: sleep deprivation among 97 female and three male
   healthy nurses of age 20-50 years was assessed by epworth sleepiness
   scale (ess). cognition was assessed by montreal cognitive assessment
   (moca) questionnaire. mobile applications were used to test their
   vigilance, reaction time, photographic memory and numerical cognition.
   the above said parameters were assessed during end of day shift and 3-4
   days after start of night shift.
   results: poor sleep quality was observed among 69\% of shift working
   nurses according to ess scores. the cognitive performance was analysed
   using wilcoxon signed rank test. the moca score was found to be lesser
   among 66\% of nurses during night (25.72) than day (26.81). during the
   night, 32\% made more mathematical errors. it was also found that, 71\%,
   83\% and 68\% of the nurses scored lesser during night in the stroop's
   colour test, vigilance test and memory tests respectively. thus,
   impairment in cognitive performance was statistically significant
   (p<0.001) among shift working nurses.
   conclusion: cognitive performance was found to be impaired among shift

   objective: the study aims to assess the quality of current mobile apps
   for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) training and real incident
   support from expert as well as end-user perspective.
   methods: two independent medical experts evaluated the medical content
   of cpr apps from the google play store and the apple app store. the
   evaluation was based on pre-defined minimum medical content requirements
   according to current basic life support (bls) guidelines. in a second
   phase, non-medical end-users tested usability and appeal of the apps
   that had at least met the minimum requirements. usability was assessed
   with the system usability scale (sus); appeal was measured with the
   self-developed reactiondeck toolkit.
   results: out of 61 apps, 46 were included in the experts' evaluation. a
   consolidated list of 13 apps resulted for the following layperson
   evaluation. the interrater reliability was substantial (kappa=.61).
   layperson end-users (n=14) had a high interrater reliability (intraclass

   systems (cdsms) provides an effective solution to these problems. the
   purpose of the study is to develop a user-friendly, comprehensive, fully
   integrated web and mobile-based clinical decision support and monitoring
   system (cdsms) for the screening, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring
   of dm diseases which is used by physicians and patients in primary care
   and to determine the effectiveness of the system.
   methods: the cdsms will be based on evidence-based guidelines for dm
   disease. a web and mobile-based application will be developed in which
   the physician will remotely monitor patient data through mobile
   applications in real time. the developed cdsms will be tested in two
   stages. in the first stage, the usability, understandability, and
   adequacy of the application will be determined. five primary care
   physicians will use the developed application for at least 16 dm
   patients. necessary improvements will be made according to physician
   feedback. in the second phase, a parallel, single-blind, randomized
   controlled trial will be implemented. dm diagnosed patients will be
   recruited for the cdsms trial by their primary care physicians. ten
   physicians and their 439 patients will be involved in the study.
   eligible participants will be assigned to intervention and control
   groups with simple randomization. the significance level will be
   accepted as p < 0.05. in the intervention group, the system will make
   recommendations on patient monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment. these
   recommendations will be implemented at the physician's discretion.
   patients in the control group will be treated by physicians according to
   current dm treatment standards. patients in both groups will be
   monitored for 6 months. patient data will be compared between 0th and
   6th month of the study.. clinical and laboratory outcomes will be
   assessed in person while others will be self-assessed online.
   discussion: the developed system will be the first of its kind to
   utilize evidence based guidelines to provide health services to dm
   patients.}},

   tourism and involves the use of mobile devices as electronic tourist
   guides. while much of the underlying technology is already available,
   there are still open challenges with respect to design, usability,
   portability, functionality and implementation aspects. most existing
   ``mobile tourism'' solutions either represent of-the-shelf applications
   with rigidly defined content or involve portable devices with networking
   capabilities that access tourist content with the requirement of
   constant airtime, i.e., continuous wireless network coverage. this paper
   presents the design and implementation issues of a ``mobile tourism''
   research prototype, which brings together the main assets of the two
   aforementioned approaches. namely, it enables the creation of portable
   tourist applications with rich content that matches user preferences.
   the users may download these personalized applications (optimized for
   their specific device's model) either directly to their mobile device or
   first to a pc and then to a mobile terminal (through infrared or
   bluetooth). thereafter, network coverage is not further required as the
   applications execute in standalone mode and may be updated when the user
   returns online. the dynamically created tourist applications also
   incorporate a ``push model'', wherein new tourist content is forwarded
   to the mobile terminal with minimal user intervention as soon as it is
   added or updated by the administrator. our prototype has been developed
   on the top of java 2 micro edition (j2me) which offers an ideal platform
   for the development of full-fledged, interactive and portable
   applications tailored for resource-constrained mobile devices. the paper
   presents our development experiences with j2me and highlights its main
   advantages and shortcomings in relation to the implementation of such
   kind of applications. finally, an empirical evaluation of user
   experience with the mobile application prototype is presented.}},

   predominantly driven only by the marked trends and the individual energy
   savings are moderate, the sheer number of users makes this global trend
   promising and a model for sustainable energy. the energy consumption of
   selected smart devices was tested using 42 frequently used applications
   and utilities (e. g., portable gaming, scanning, music players, etc.). a
   range of operating systems (os) were selected for testing: android os
   (google), blackberry os (rim), ios (apple), and windows 7 os
   (microsoft). testing was conducted using the following smartphones:
   blackberry curve 9300, iphone 4, samsung focus, samsung galaxy s; and
   tablets: ipad 2 and samsung galaxy tablet 7 `'. in order to investigate
   the battery consumption, two programs were developed in-house for ios
   and android platforms. for the windows phone, the built-in program was
   utilized, while a third-party application was used for the blackberry
   phone. to further test the battery, each device was also decoupled from
   its battery and hooked up through a measuring device, and experiments
   were then repeated. this study shows smart devices save consumers up to
   \$150 annually compared to single-function devices in a range of
   applications. the results from this study demonstrate how smart devices
   are transforming our society by providing superior functionality at a
   lesser cost in energy, paving the way for other technologies to be

   oncological patients.
   methods: we developed an app prototype for the ios operating system
   within eight months in three phases: conception, initial development,
   and pilot testing. for the hrqol assessment, we chose to implement only
   the european organization for research and treatment of cancer (eortc)
   quality of life questionnaire-core 30 (qlq-c30; german version 3).
   usability testing was conducted for three months. participation was
   voluntary and pseudonymized. after completion of the qlq-c30
   questionnaire using ipads provided by our department, we performed a
   short survey with 10 questions. this survey inquired about patients'
   opinions regarding general aspects, including technical advances in
   medicine, mobile and app assistance during cancer treatment, and the
   app-specific functions (eg, interface and navigation).
   results: after logging into the app, the user can choose between

   mobile version of the hrqol questionnaire instead of a paper-based
   version. using the app in daily life during and after cancer treatment
   would be supported by 83\% (67/81) of participants. in the prototype
   version of the app, data were stored on the device; in the future, 79\%
   (64/81) of the patients would agree to transfer data via the internet.
   conclusions: our usability test showed good results regarding
   attractiveness, operability, and understandability. moreover, our
   results demonstrate a high overall acceptance of mobile apps and
   telemedicine in oncology. the hrqol assessment via the app was accepted
   thoroughly by patients, and individuals are keen to use it in clinical
   routines, while data privacy and security must be ensured.}},

   maximization of told work done, battery life time extension and weighted
   combination of work done and battery lifetime. we divide the total
   energy available in the battery into fired slots which we call
   reconfiguration slots. integer linear program formulations are used to
   find the best constraint-satisfying sequence of cores offline. each

   cross-sectional study to assess medical students' preclinical and
   clinical management knowledge of prediabetes and diabetes prevention.
   medical students attending the 2016 american medical association's
   annual meeting took a 6-item knowledge questionnaire using a mobile
   application or a paper version. scores were reported for the full sample
   of respondents, by year in medical school, by topic area, and by mode of

   the questionnaire questions correctly. scores on some items addressing
   preclinical content were higher among third- and fourth-year students
   compared to first- and second-year students (p=0.039 and effect
   size=0.363). average scores on the items addressing clinical management
   were not significantly different by year in medical school, but the item

   technology. application of ceramics as body material ensures sufficient
   stability and a wide working temperature range. first tests proved that
   melting processes with promising dynamic performance can be detected.

   decision-making subsystem is utilized to tune the retrieval preferences
   of the query user. we assess our ideas both using trace-driven
   experiments with mobility and social patterns derived by microsoft's

   investigated that goes beyond the traditional model of parallel graphene
   sheets hosting layers of physisorbed hydrogen in slit-shaped pores of
   variable width. the investigation focuses on structures with locally
   planar units (unbounded or bounded fragments of graphene sheets), and
   variable ratios of in-plane to edge atoms. adsorption of molecular
   hydrogen on these structures was studied by performing grand canonical
   monte carlo simulations with appropriately chosen adsorbent-adsorbate
   interaction potentials. the interaction models were tested by comparing
   simulated adsorption isotherms with experimental isotherms on a
   high-performance activated carbon with well-defined pore structure
   (approximately bimodal pore-size distribution), and remarkable agreement
   between computed and experimental isotherms was obtained, both for
   gravimetric excess adsorption and for gravimetric storage capacity. from
   this analysis and the simulations performed on the new structures, a
   rich spectrum of relationships between structural characteristics of
   carbons and ensuing hydrogen adsorption (structure-function
   relationships) emerges: (i) storage capacities higher than in
   slit-shaped pores can be obtained by fragmentation/truncation of
   graphene sheets, which creates surface areas exceeding of 2600 m(2)/g,
   the maximum surface area for infinite graphene sheets, carried mainly by
   edge sites; we call the resulting structures open carbon frameworks
   (ocf). (ii) for ocfs with a ratio of in-plane to edge sites approximate
   to 1 and surface areas 3800-6500 m(2)/g, we found record maximum excess
   adsorption of 75-85 g of h-2/kg of c at 77 k and record storage capacity
   of 100-260 g of h-2/kg of c at 77 k and 100 bar. (iii) the adsorption in
   structures having large specific surface area built from small
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons cannot be further increased because
   their energy of adsorption is low. (iv) additional increase of hydrogen
   uptake could potentially be achieved by chemical substitution and/or
   intercalation of ocf structures, in order to increase the energy of
   adsorption. we conclude that ocf structures, if synthesized, will give
   hydrogen uptake at the level required for mobile applications. the
   conclusions define the physical limits of hydrogen adsorption in
   carbon-based porous structures.}},

   perceived usefulness, perceived security, perceived ease of use, trust,
   grievance redressal and satisfaction on young users' intention to
   continually use m-wallet in india.
   design/methodology/approach - a research framework based on the
   expectation-confirmation theory has been formulated and tested
   empirically using data from m-wallets young users in india using
   structural equation modeling.
   findings - the analysis reveals that perceived usefulness and perceived
   ease of use significantly affect user satisfaction and intention to
   continually use m-wallets. the effect of perceived security on user
   satisfaction is significant, and grievance redressal mediates the effect
   of perceived security on intention to continually use m-wallets.
   practical implications - the outcome of the research will help m-wallet
   service providers and policy makers in planning the service and
   increasing customer' continuance intention.
   originality/value - the uniqueness of this research is that it adds two
   important constructs for mobile payment systems (grievance redressal and
   perceived security) that were missing in the earlier model proposed by
   zhou (2013). the addition of the two constructs helped in formulating a

  abstract             = {{flow batteries using suspension electrodes, e.g., zinc-air flow
   batteries (zabs), have recently gained renewed interest as potential
   candidates for grid energy storage or mobile applications. the
   performance of zabs depends on the local flow conditions of the
   suspension in the electrochemical cell, which acts as an electrode.
   hence, it is crucial to measure and understand the complex flow
   characteristics of such solid-liquid suspensions. the investigated
   suspension electrode is an opaque slurry that consists of microscopic
   zinc particles and an aqueous potassium hydroxide electrolyte. commonly,
   ultrasound doppler velocimetry is used for flow imaging in opaque
   fluids. however, due to the high particle concentration in the
   suspension electrode, strong scattering and wavefront distortions of the
   ultrasound are introduced. in this paper, we show that this results in
   an increased measurement uncertainty for doppler-based velocity
   estimation. instead, ultrasound image velocimetry is applied to measure
   the 2-d and two-component flow field in the zinc-electrolyte suspension.
   this is possible by adapting the measurement system to the suspension
   with a calibration setup. the total measurement uncertainties of 4.1\%
   and 2.5\% for the axial and lateral flow components are derived from the
   calibration measurements. for the first time, the flow field of such a
   suspension could be measured in a scaled fluidic model of a zab. the
   comparison of the estimated flow rates from the velocity profiles showed
   good agreement to a gravimetric reference. a significant difference in
   the flow characteristics of a macroscopically homogeneous electrolyte
   and the same electrolyte loaded with 8 vol.-\% zinc particles, i.e., the
   suspension electrode, was found. along with the demonstration of the
   measurement technique for opaque, concentrated suspensions, the
   measurement data will be used to calibrate and validate numerical models
   for comparable multiphase fluids.}},

   metrics extracted from thigh orientation signal in a sample of healthy
   young adults. main results: smartphone sensors provided valid
   measurements of movement timing and amplitude variables. however, sensor
   firmware version and android os version significantly affected quality
   of measurement. high test-retest reliability was shown for the temporal
   and spatial variables of interest during the stepping-in-place task.
   significance: collectively, these experiments show that our smartphone
   application is a valid and reliable way to measure leg movement
   characteristics (mean stride time and its variability (cv), peak thigh
   sd, thigh rom, and peak return velocity) during dynamic balance
   activity, which could provide an objective way to assess neuromotor
   function after head trauma and in other populations with balance

   conventional nature. the conventional sources of energy used are one of
   the major participants in pollution, and they are inefficient and
   unreliable in securing the national energy security. morocco is energy
   dependent as it imports about 97\% of its energy needs. to improve the

   smart grids, namely, the residential microgrid. the development of a
   home energy management mobile application on smart devices (phones,
   tablets, etc.) is presented which has as goals the establishment of a
   two-way flow of power and data, and the management of residual energy.
   in addition, the mobile application architecture and design are
   detailed. methods for testing the application are suggested, and

  abstract       = {{quantifying the amount of crop residue left in the field after harvest
   is a key issue for sustainability. conventional assessment approaches
   (e.g., line-transect) are labor intensive, time-consuming and costly.
   many proximal remote sensing devices and systems have been developed for
   agricultural applications such as cover crop and residue mapping. for
   instance, current mobile devices (smartphones \& tablets) are usually
   equipped with digital cameras and global positioning systems and use
   applications (apps) for in-field data collection and analysis. in this
   study, we assess the feasibility and strength of a mobile device app
   developed to estimate crop residue cover. the performance of this novel
   technique (from here on referred to as ``app{''} method) was compared
   against two point counting approaches: an established digital
   photograph-grid method and a new automated residue counting script
   developed in matlab at the university of guelph. both photograph-grid
   and script methods were used to count residue under 100 grid points.
   residue percent cover was estimated using the app, script and
   photograph-grid methods on 54 vertical digital photographs (images of
   the ground taken from above at a height of 1.5 m) collected from
   eighteen fields (9 corn and 9 soybean, 3 samples each) located in
   southern ontario. results showed that residue estimates from the app
   method were in good agreement with those obtained from both
   photograph-grid and script methods (r-2 = 0.86 and 0.84, respectively).
   this study has found that the app underestimates the residue coverage by
   6.3\% and 10.8\% when compared to the photograph-grid and script
   methods, respectively. with regards to residue type, soybean has a
   slightly lower bias than corn (i. e., 5.3\% vs. 7.4\%). for photos with
   residue < 30\%, the app derived residue measurements are within +/- 5\%
   difference (bias) of both photograph-grid-and script-derived residue
   measurements. these methods could therefore be used to track the
   recommended minimum soil residue cover of 30\%, implemented to reduce
   farmland topsoil and nutrient losses that impact water quality. overall,
   the app method was found to be a good alternative to the point counting
   methods, which are more time-consuming.}},

   the evaluation presented herein focusses on gps and galileo. static and

   conditions are reported. differential gnss methods and precise point
   positioning (ppp) are used to assess absolute position accuracy in itrf
   coordinates, which is sufficiently close to the gps and galileo
   reference frame for the current purpose. under low multipath conditions,
   measurements are found to be sufficiently accurate to provide single
   epoch, bias free position accuracy of a few metres. accuracy is a
   function of signal attenuation and multipath conditions. the use of an
   external geodetic antenna significantly reduces measurement noise and
   multipath in high multipath environments. carrier phase measurements,
   available more or less continuously under open sky conditions,
   significantly improve performance in differential mode. accuracy in
   vehicular mode using code and carrier phase differential rtk solution is
   at the level of a few to several dm. tests were conducted in parallel

   have shown that context-driven control approaches using internet of

   energy saving in heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. in
   this article, an intelligent control approach using a state feedback
   technique is introduced to regulate the heating, ventilation and air

   thermal state feedback control was then implemented and deployed in our
   eeblab to study its effectiveness in a real-setting scenario. the
   performance of the proposed control was evaluated in a real test-site by
   deploying a control card that links the controller with the heating,

   real feedback control was also developed and deployed to dynamically
   adapt the controller to context's changes. the mobile application and
   the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system communicate and

   this article, a holistic platform that combines internet of things and
   data stream processing technologies was developed and deployed in a
   real-setting scenario. experiments have been performed, and results are

   propensity of states to use ios to promote narrow national interests
   rather than broader organizational objectives. ios that enjoy policy
   autonomy vis-a-vis states will thus exhibit higher levels of
   performance. however, in the international context policy autonomy
   cannot be guaranteed by institutional design. instead, it is a function
   of (1) the existence of (certain types of) institutionalized alliances
   between ios and actors above and below the state; and (2) the technical
   complexity of io activities. i provide empirical evidence for the
   argument by constructing and analyzing a cross-sectional data set on io

  abstract       = {{background: recently, the use of smartphones to deliver health-related
   content has experienced rapid growth, with more than 165,000 mobile
   health (mhealth) apps currently available in the digital marketplace.
   with 3 out of 4 canadians currently owning a smartphone, mhealth apps
   offer opportunities to deliver accessible health-related knowledge and
   support. many individuals experience pain after surgery, which can
   negatively impact their health-related quality of life, including sleep,
   emotional, and social functioning. smartphone apps that provide remote
   real-time monitoring and symptom management have the potential to
   improve self-management skills in patients experiencing postoperative
   pain. increased confidence and practice of self-management skills could
   contribute to decreased postoperative pain and reduce risk of developing
   persistent pain. published reviews of general pain self-management apps
   demonstrate a lack of evidence-based content, theoretical grounding, and
   health care professional involvement. however, no review to date has
   focused on the app marketplace specific for individuals with
   postoperative pain.
   objective: the aim of this study was to characterize and critically
   appraise the content and functionality of commercially available
   postoperative pain self-management apps.
   methods: an electronic search and extraction was conducted between
   december 2016 and march 2017 of the official canadian app stores for the
   three major smartphone operating systems (iphone operating system
   {[}ios], android, and windows). stores were searched separately using
   predetermined search terms. two authors screened apps based on
   information provided in the public app description. metadata from all
   included apps were abstracted into a standard spreadsheet. two authors
   verified the data with reference to the apps and downloaded apps
   themselves. the content and functionality of each app as it pertained to
   postoperative pain self-management was rated.
   results: a total of 10 apps met the inclusion criteria. all included
   apps were designed exclusively for the android platform. education was
   the most common self-management feature offered (8/10, 80\%), with none
   of the apps offering features related to goal setting or social support.
   overall, no single app was comprehensive in terms of pain
   self-management content. five (50\%) apps reported the involvement of a
   health care provider in their development. however, not a single app
   involved end users in their development, and none of the apps underwent
   scientific evaluation. additionally, none of the apps were designed for
   use in pediatric patients.
   conclusions: currently available postoperative pain apps for patients
   lack evidence-based content, goal setting, and social support functions.
   there is a need to develop and test comprehensive theory-based apps to
   support patients with pain self-management care following surgery.}},

   qualitative description approach to review and categorize feedback from
   participants.
   results: mean total time to complete the scenarios using the nfcma and
   the bcma systems was 202 seconds and 182 seconds, respectively (p=.09).
   mean scan attempts with the nfcma was 7.6 attempts compared with 6.5
   attempts with the bcma system (p=.12). in the usability survey, 95\%
   (19/20) of participants agreed that the prototype nfcma system was easy
   to use and easy to learn, with a pleasant interface. participants
   expressed interest in using the nfcma tablet in the hospital;
   suggestions focused on implementation issues, such as storage of the
   mobile devices and infection control methods.
   conclusions: the nfcma system had similar efficiency to the bcma system

  abstract          = {{testing is a vital activity in software development. the iso/iec has
   defined a standard for system and software quality models called iso/iec
   25010:2011 to be a guideline and scope for testing any applications.
   testing of mobile applications according to this standard, however, is
   more challenging than other types of software. the diversity of android
   devices and various versions of android operating system, for example,
   has created a large fragmentation of the android platform. this
   fragmentation hinders testing of android applications especially in
   relation to portability and compatibility. existing solutions are either
   neglecting portability and compatibility issues or lack flexibility in
   fulfilling needs of the different organizations. we propose a cloud
   testing model to address the fragmentation of android platform and
   provide automated application testing services on the actual devices.
   the model can be configured in the public, private or hybrid setups to
   suit individual organizations' needs and budget. a prototype was built
   based on the model. 10 android testers used the prototype and the
   android emulator to perform mobile application testing. results show
   that the model has the potential to manage the challenging portability
   and compatibility testing on the android platform in a flexible and
   scalable manner.}},

  abstract  = {{standby leakage current minimization is a pressing concern for mobile
   applications that rely on standby modes to extend battery life. in this
   paper, we propose new leakage current reduction methods in standby mode.
   first, we propose a combined approach of sleep-state assignment and
   threshold voltage (v-t) assignment in a dual-v-t process for
   subthreshold leakage (i-sub) reduction. second, for the minimization of
   gate oxide leakage current (i-gate) which has become comparable to i-sub
   in 90-nm technologies, we extend the above method to a combined
   sleep-state, v-t and gate oxide thickness (t-ox) assignments approach in
   a dual-v-t and dual-t-ox process to minimize both i-sub and i-gate. by
   combining v-t or v-t/t-ox assignment with sleep-state assignment,
   leakage current can be dramatically reduced since the circuit is in a
   known state in standby mode and only certain transistors are responsible
   for leakage current and need to be considered for high-v-t or thick-t-ox
   assignment. a significant improvement in the leakage/performance
   tradeoff is therefore achievable using such combined methods. we
   formulate the optimization problem for simultaneous state/v-t and
   state/v-t/t-ox assignments under delay constraints and propose both an
   exact method for its optimal solution as well as two practical
   heuristics with reasonable run time. we implemented and tested the
   proposed methods on a set of synthesized benchmark circuits and show
   substantial leakage current reduction compared to the previous
   approaches using only state assignment or vt assignment alone.}},

  abstract             = {{background: to evaluate patients with fever of unknown origin or those
   with suspected bacteremia, the precision of blood culture tests is
   critical. an inappropriate step in the test process or error in a
   parameter could lead to a false-positive result, which could then affect
   the direction of treatment in critical conditions. mobile health apps
   can be used to resolve problems with blood culture tests, and such apps
   can hence ensure that point-of-care guidelines are followed and
   processes are monitored for blood culture tests.
   objective: in this pilot project, we aimed to investigate the
   feasibility of using a mobile blood culture app to manage blood culture
   test quality. we implemented the app at a university hospital in south
   korea to assess the potential for its utilization in a clinical
   environment by reviewing the usage data among a small group of users and
   by assessing their feedback and the data related to blood culture
   sampling.
   methods: we used an ios-based blood culture app that uses an embedded
   camera to scan the patient identification and sample number bar codes. a
   total of 4 medical interns working at 2 medical intensive care units
   (micus) participated in this project, which spanned 3 weeks. app usage
   and blood culture sampling parameters (including sampler, sampling site,
   sampling time, and sample volume) were analyzed. the compliance of
   sampling parameter entry was also measured. in addition, the
   participants' opinions regarding patient safety, timeliness, efficiency,
   and usability were recorded.
   results: in total, 356/644 (55.3\%) of all blood culture samples
   obtained at the micus were examined using the app, including 254/356
   (71.3\%) with blood collection volumes of 5-7 ml and 256/356 (71.9\%)
   with blood collection from the peripheral veins. the sampling volume
   differed among the participants. sampling parameters were completely
   entered in 354/356 cases (99.4\%). all the participants agreed that the
   app ensured good patient safety, disagreed on its timeliness, and did
   not believe that it was efficient. although the bar code scanning speed
   was acceptable, the wi-fi environment required improvement. moreover,
   the participants requested feedback regarding their sampling quality.
   conclusions: although this app could be used in the clinical setting,
   improvements in the app functions, environment network, and internal
   policy of blood culture testing are needed to ensure hospital-wide use.}},

   korea (rok) has been largely affected by the fluctuations in the energy
   markets around the world. such a situation has provided a basis for
   requiring improvements to power plant facilities. the automatic
   generator voltage control systems in large-scale power plants are
   adopting a rapid-response static excitation method to improve the
   transient stability. a domestic commercially developed large-scale
   triple-redundant excitation system is currently operated by the 1000
   mw-class nuclear power plant and its efficiency has been verified at the
   same site. however, such a system is too costly for smaller power plants
   so that a reliable and low-cost redundant digital excitation control
   system was developed and introduced in this study to resolve the cost
   problem. the system has improved its stability and reliability at the
   same time through double (redundant) configuration. additionally, the
   system's performance was put to the test by conducting a series of
   control function tests after applying it to the gas turbine used in a
   thermal power station. this study includes the development of system
   hardware, simulations as well as on-site experiments and each element
   was validated as a result. also, the study discusses and validates the
   method used for replacing the protective relays at the kanudi power
   plant operating in papua new guinea. the replacement of 27 and 81
   protective relays at the existing power plant was carried out as they
   did not function properly. new relays were installed after removing the
   power supply in the existing panel. the individual power output sections
   of new relays were connected in parallel with the existing properly
   functioning relays, as previous protective relays had only allowed
   monitoring without outputting the contents. thus, the new protective
   system was designed to enable both existing and new relays to carry out
   the detection function. it was validated that the replacement was
   successful. the new system with the new relays is performing properly by
   protecting its power generator and preventing further accidents.}},

   on the usability or usage patterns of memrs through user surveys,
   investigations based on the real data usage are lacking.
   objective: asan medical center, a tertiary hospital in seoul, korea,
   implemented an memr program in 2010. on the basis of the memr usage log
   data collected over a period of 4.5 years, we aimed to identify a usage
   pattern and trends in accordance with user occupation and to disseminate
   the factors that make the memr more effective and efficient.
   methods: the memr log data were collected from march 2012 to august
   2016. descriptive analyses were completed according to user occupation,
   access time, services, and wireless network type. specifically, analyses
   targeted were as follows: (1) the status of the memr usage and
   distribution of users, (2) trends in the number of users and usage
   amount, (3) 24-hour usage patterns, and (4) trends in service usage
   based on user occupations. linear regressions were performed to model
   the relationship between the time, access frequency, and the number of
   users. the differences between the user occupations were examined using
   student t tests for categorical variables.
   results: approximately two-thirds of the doctors and nurses used the
   memr. the number of logs studied was 7,144,459. among 3859 users, 2333
   (60.46\%) users were nurses and 1102 (28.56\%) users were doctors. on
   average, the memr was used 1044 times by 438 users per day. the number
   of users and amount of access logs have significantly increased since
   2012 (p<.001). nurses used the memr 3 times more often than doctors. the
   use of memr by nurses increased by an annual average of 51.5\%, but use
   by doctors decreased by an annual average of 7.7\%. for doctors, the
   peak usage periods were observed during 08:00 to 09:00 and 17:00 to
   18:00, which were coincident with the beginning of ward rounds.
   conversely, the peak usage periods for the nurses were observed during
   05:00 to 06:00, 12:00 to 13:00, and 20:00 to 21:00, which effectively
   occurred 1 or 2 hours before handover. in more than 80\% of all cases,
   the memr was accessed via a nonhospital wireless network.
   conclusions: the usage patterns of the memr differed between doctors and
   nurses according to their different workflows. in both occupations, memr
   was highly used when personal computer access was limited and the need
   for patient information was high, such as during ward rounds or handover
   periods.}},

   the uptake of and adherence to pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) among
   ymsm and ytwsm is currently limited. to date, evidence-based
   interventions to promote and sustain prep adherence have been limited
   and not shown to be highly efficacious. given the widespread adoption of
   smartphones, mobile apps can be utilized to increase prep adherence for
   many ymsm and ytwsm.
   objective: the study consists of a formative research phase to develop
   an app-based intervention, p3 (prepared, protected, empowered), to
   increase prep adherence, and a randomized controlled trial (rct) to test
   its efficacy. p3 is a mobile app built on an established health
   platform, which includes social networking and game-based components to
   encourage prep adherence among ymsm and ytwsm. p3+ includes all p3
   features plus adherence counseling delivered via two-way text messaging
   (short message service, sms) through the app.
   methods: the formative research phase includes usability testing to
   assess users' comprehension of p3's educational content, understanding
   and use of intervention features, and overall impressions of app
   functionality, followed by app refinements. a subsequent field trial
   will identify and resolve any remaining technical challenges. a
   three-arm rct (p3, p3+, and standard of care) will then be conducted at

   to conduct a comparison of costs to deliver the 2 intervention arms.
   results: this is an ongoing research project with initial results from
   the formative work expected in 2020 and those from the rct in 2021.
   conclusions: p3 aims to provide an engaging, interactive experience that
   is highly appealing for the target population, leveraging technology
   already heavily integrated into the lives of young people, and thus
   meeting users' needs in a familiar, stimulating way. if efficacious, p3
   could be a sustainable, easily disseminated, lower-cost prep
   intervention for ymsm and ytwsm. further, the research aims to determine
   the processes that are essential to developing and implementing future
   health-related gamification interventions.}},

   transmission of hiv. however, ymsm often struggle with art adherence.
   novel mobile phone apps that incorporate game-based mechanics and social
   networking elements represent a promising intervention approach for
   improving art adherence among ymsm.
   objective: this study used a multiphase, iterative development process
   to create an art adherence app for ymsm.
   methods: the three-phase development process included: (1) theory-based
   concept development jointly by public health researchers and the
   technology team, (2) assessment of the target population's art adherence
   needs and app preferences and development and testing of a clickable app
   prototype, and (3) development and usability testing of the final app
   prototype.
   results: the initial theory-based app concept developed in phase one
   included medication reminders, daily art adherence tracking and
   visualization, art educational modules, limited virtual interactions
   with other app users, and gamification elements. in phase two, adherence
   needs, including those related to information, motivation, and
   behavioral skills, were identified. participants expressed preferences
   for an art adherence app that was informational, interactive, social,
   and customizable. based on the findings from phase two, additional
   gaming features were added in phase three, including an interactive
   battle, superhero app theme, and app storyline. other features were
   modified to increase interactivity and customization options and

   research indicates that interventions delivered via smartphone apps are
   suitable in promoting self-monitoring of alcohol use, have a broad
   reach, and may be more cost-effective than other types of brief
   interventions. there is currently no such intervention specifically
   designed for the armed forces.
   objective: this study sought to describe the development of a tailored
   smartphone app and personalized text messaging (short message service,
   sms) framework and to test the usability and feasibility (measured and
   reported as user engagement) of this app in a hard-to-engage ex-serving
   population.
   methods: app development used agile methodology (an incremental,
   iterative approach used in software development) and was informed by
   behavior change theory, participant feedback, and focus groups.
   participants were recruited between may 2017 and june 2017 from an
   existing united kingdom longitudinal military health and well-being
   cohort study, prescreened for eligibility, and directed to download
   either android or ios versions of the ``information about drinking for
   ex-serving personnel{''} (index) app. through the app, participants were
   asked to record alcohol consumption, complete a range of self-report
   measures, and set goals using implementation intentions (if-then plans).

   text messages (sms) corresponding to specific behavior change techniques
   with content informed by the health action process approach with the
   intended purpose of promoting the use of the drinks diary, suggesting
   alternative behaviors, and providing feedback on goals setting.
   results: invitations to take part in the study were sent to ex-serving
   personnel, 22.6\% (31/137) of whom accepted and downloaded the app.
   participants opened the index app a median of 15.0 (interquartile range
   {[}iqr] 8.5-19.0) times during the 4 week period (28 days), received an
   average of 36.1 (sd 3.2) text messages (sms), consumed alcohol on a

   of cyber security. traditional methods like signature-based routines are
   unable to protect users from the ever-increasing sophistication and

   a novel and highly reliable classifier for android malware detection
   based on a factorization machine architecture and the extraction of
   android app features from manifest files and source code. our results
   indicate that the numerical feature representation of an app typically
   results in a long and highly sparse vector and that the interactions
   among different features are critical to revealing malicious behavior
   patterns. after performing an extensive performance evaluation, our
   proposed method achieved a test result of 100.00\% precision score on

   volume pulse waves were acquired by a smart phone with its built-in

   co-located wireless devices that have both an expensive unicast
   base-station-to-device (b2d) interface, as well as an inexpensive
   broadcast device-to-device (d2d) interface, which can be used
   simultaneously. our setting is a streaming system that uses a
   block-by-block random linear coding approach to achieve a target
   percentage of on-time deliveries with minimal b2d usage. our goal is to
   design an incentive framework that would promote such cooperation across
   devices, while ensuring good quality of service. based on ideas drawn
   from truth-telling auctions, we design a mechanism that achieves this
   goal via appropriate transfers (monetary payments or rebates) in a
   setting with a large number of devices, and with peer arrivals and
   departures. here, we show that a mean field game can be used to
   accurately approximate our system. furthermore, the complexity of
   calculating the best responses under this regime is low. we implement
   the proposed system on an android testbed, and illustrate its efficient
   performance using real world experiments.}},

  abstract          = {{power management on current mobile devices relies on os modules known as
   dvfs governors. however, existing governors determine system
   configuration only based on low-level information such as cpu load
   without any input about application-level behaviors. in particular,
   there exists no communication from mobile apps to energy managers. we
   find that information about app usage scenarios (e.g., gaming, video
   chatting) can usually help energy manager perform a better job and
   achieve more energy savings. although app-level energy optimizations
   have been proposed, they generally focus on single usage scenarios and
   do not address optimization across multiple scenarios.
   in this paper, we propose sceneman, an energy optimization framework for
   mobile apps based on usage scenario notification. sceneman has three
   components: an api, a scenario notifier, and an energy manager. the key
   idea is to make energy managers aware of app-level scenarios. at
   runtime, apps notify the energy manager about their usage scenarios with
   provided apis used by developers. the energy manager then takes
   appropriate actions to minimize energy consumption of the running
   scenario while meeting performance requirements. energy optimization
   across scenarios can thus be easily achieved. the framework requires
   little extra programming effort and can help apps achieve better energy
   efficiency in a transparent way. we implement our system on a nexus 6
   smartphone and test it with 13 real-world apps under 2 usage scenarios,
   namely, gaming and video chatting. we achieve up to 33.2\% energy
   savings with a worst-case performance loss of 5.1\%.}},

   the people of a sudden rise in skin temperature and can advise them to

   the android and iphone platform, the device is able to monitor real-time
   skin temperature and alerts the people who are vulnerable to a
   heatstroke. the three-dimensional printable resin developed can change
   color at a specific activation temperature. the device has undergone a
   series of performance tests in order to optimize the color transition
   rate and stability of color change. the accuracy of our device is
   compared to the conventional thermometer; the regression analysis shows

   health monitoring. with growing mobility in modern internet-of-things
   (iot) applications, the health monitoring of mobile structures becomes
   an emerging application. in this paper, we develop a uav-carried
   vision-based monitoring system that allows a uav to continuously track
   and monitor a mobile infrastructure and transmit back the monitoring
   information in real-time from a remote location. the monitoring system
   uses a simple uav-mounted camera and requires only a single feature
   located on the mobile infrastructure for target detection and tracking.
   the computation-effective vision-based tracking solution based on a
   single feature is an improvement over existing vision-based
   lead-follower tracking systems that either have poor tracking
   performance due to the use of a single feature, or have improved
   tracking performance at a cost of the usage of multiple features. in
   addition, a uav-carried aerial networking infrastructure using
   directional antennas is used to enable robust real-time transmission of
   monitoring video streams over a long distance. automatic heading control
   is used to self-align headings of directional antennas to enable robust
   communication in mobility. compared to existing omni-communication
   systems, the directional communication solution significantly increases
   the operation range of remote monitoring systems. in this paper, we
   develop the integrated modeling framework of camera and mobile
   platforms, design the tracking algorithm, develop a testbed of uavs and

  abstract      = {{opportunistic signals (e.g., wifi, magnetic fields, and ambient light)
   have been extensively studied for low-cost indoor localization,
   especially via fingerprinting. we present an automatic site survey
   approach to build the signal maps in space-constrained environments
   (e.g., modern office buildings). the survey can be completed by a single
   smartphone user during normal walking, say, with a little human
   intervention. our approach follows the classical graphslam framework:
   the front end constructs a pose graph by incorporating the relative
   motion constraints from the pedestrian dead-reckoning (pdr), the
   loop-closure constraints by magnetic sequence matching with the wifi
   signal similarity validation, and the global heading constraints from
   the opportunistic magnetic heading measurements; and the back end
   generates a globally consistent trajectory via graph optimization to
   provide ground-truth locations for the collected signal fingerprints
   along the survey path. we then build the signal map (also known as
   fingerprint database) upon these location-labeled fingerprints by the
   gaussian processes regression (gpr) for later online localization.
   specifically, we exploit the pseudowall constraints from the gpr
   variance map of magnetic fields and the observations of ceiling lights
   to correct the pdr drifts with a particle filter. we evaluate our
   approach on several data sets collected from both the hkust academic
   building and a shopping mall. we demonstrate the real-time localization
   on a smartphone in an office area, with 50th percentile accuracy of 2.30
   m and 90th percentile accuracy of 3.41 m. note to practitioners-this
   paper was motivated by the problem of the efficient signal map
   construction for fingerprinting-based localization on smartphones. the
   conventional manual site survey method, known to be time-consuming and
   labor-intensive, hinders the penetration of fingerprinting methods in
   practice. this paper suggests a graphslam-based approach to automate
   this signal map construction process by reducing the survey overhead
   significantly. a surveyor is merely asked to walk through an indoor
   venue with an android smartphone held in hand with a little human
   intervention. meanwhile, opportunistic signals (e.g., wifi and magnetic
   fields) are captured by smartphone sensors. we construct a graphslam
   engine to first identify the measurement constraints from these signal
   observations and then recover the surveyor's walking trajectory by the
   graph optimization. we can generate signal maps using the captured
   signals alongside the recovered trajectory. in this paper, we propose a
   wifi signal similarity validation method to reduce false positive
   loop-closures and exploit the magnetic headings to improve the
   trajectory optimization performance. in addition, we propose to use the
   generated magnetic field variance map and the lights distribution map
   for localization. the efficacy of the proposed site survey approach is
   proven through field experiments, and real-time localization is
   demonstrated on a smartphone using the generated signal maps. the
   localization experiment was conducted by a single user with the same
   android smartphone that was used in the site survey. therefore, the
   usability of signal maps on other devices and the generality to other
   users have not yet been testified. we will leave these issues in our
   future work.}},

   to develop an online artefact detection system based on adaptive
   (dynamic) template matching, suitable for continuous ppg monitoring
   during daily living activities or in the intensive care units (icus).
   approach: several master templates are initially generated by applying
   principal component analysis to data obtained from the physionet mimic
   ii database. the master template is then updated with each incoming dean
   ppg pulse. the correlation coefficient is used to classify the ppg pulse
   into either good or bad quality categories. the performance of our
   algorithm was evaluated using data obtained from two different sources:
   (i) our own data collected from 19 healthy subjects using the wearable
   sotera visi mobile system (sotera wireless inc.) as they performed
   various movement types; and (ii) icu data provided by the physionet
   mimic ii database. the developed algorithm was evaluated against a
   manually annotated `gold standard' (gs). main results: our algorithm
   achieved an overall accuracy of 91.5\% +/- 2.9\%, with a sensitivity of
   94.1\% +/- 2.7\% and a specificity of 89.7\% +/- 5.1\%, when tested on
   our own data. when applying the algorithm to data from the physionet
   mimic ii database, it achieved an accuracy of 98.0\%, with a sensitivity
   and specificity of 99.0\% and 96.1\%, respectively. significance: the
   proposed method is simple and robust against individual variations in
   the ppg characteristics, thus making it suitable for a diverse range of
   datasets. integration of the proposed artefact detection technique into
   remote monitoring devices could enhance reliability of the ppg-derived

   optimize usability of the app; and then a 6-month pilot rct among 60
   hiv-uninfected ymsm at risk for hiv acquisition. developed using the
   information, motivation, and behavioral skills theoretical model, the
   lynx app includes an electronic diary to track sexual behaviors
   (information), a personalized risk score to promote accurate risk
   perception (information/motivation), testing reminders
   (motivation/behavioral skills), and access to home-based hiv/sti testing
   options and geospatial-based hiv/sti testing care sites (behavioral
   skills). feasibility and acceptability will be assessed through app
   analytics of usage patterns and acceptability scales administered via
   computer-assisted self-interview at 3 and 6 months. we will also
   evaluate preliminary efficacy by comparing the proportion of ymsm who
   test at least once during the 6-month pilot and the proportion who
   successfully link to a prep provider in the intervention versus control
   groups.
   results: formative work is currently underway. the lynx pilot rct will
   begin enrollment in october 2018, with study results available in 2019.
   conclusions: the lynx app is one of the first mobile apps designed to
   increase hiv/sti testing and prep uptake among ymsm. as low-perceived
   risk is a barrier to hiv/sti testing and prep use among youth, the
   personalized risk assessment and interactive sexual diary in lynx could
   assist ymsm in better understanding their hiv risk and providing
   motivation to test for hiv/stis and initiate prep. coupled with
   community-based recruitment, this novel mobile app has great potential
   to reach and engage ymsm not currently involved in care and increase
   rates of hiv/sti testing and prep uptake in this vulnerable population.}},

  abstract             = {{this paper presents a novel organic embedded trace damascene
   redistribution layer (rdl) process for panel-scale 2.5-d interposers and
   high-density fan-out package (hdfo) substrates. a minimum feature size
   of 1.5-mu m line and space using ultrathin polymer dielectrics on glass,
   silicon, and as well as on organic laminate was demonstrated. this is
   the first demonstration of a complete set of materials and processes
   that can be applied to large glass or organic panels, to bridge the
   interconnect gap between current semiadditive process (sap) rdl and
   wafer back-end-of-line (beol) rdl. the ultra-fine pitch multilayer rdl
   structures demonstrated in this paper achieve an optimum balance of high
   io density, high electrical performance, and low process costs. io
   density in terms of ios per mm per layer, as defined by intel, refers to
   the number of traces routed per millimeter of die edge on one rdl layer
   of an interposer or package substrate. the current sap technology can
   achieve an io density of about 40 ios/mm/layer on 510 mm x 510 mm
   organic laminate panels. the challenges of fabricating copper metal
   traces below 5 mu m width and 5 mu m space using conventional sap are
   discussed. on the other hand, wafer-based beol damascene rdl technology
   can scale to io densities of greater than 200 ios/mm/layer, but at
   relatively higher costs on 300-mm-diameter round wafers. an additional
   challenge for silicon interposers is low die-to-die interconnect data
   rate of single copper trace due to the high resistance of beol rdl
   structure. a combination of larger cross-sectional area with high aspect
   ratio (ar) is preferred for low-resistance, high-bandwidth escape
   routing traces. in this paper, the materials and process flow of
   embedded trace damascene rdl technology featuring trenches of 1.5 mu m
   width and 1.5 mu m space with ar of 2-4 will be described. a new 5-mu
   m-thick dry film photosensitive polymer dielectric if4605 was used for
   the trench layer as well as the via layer. a large panel-scalable
   surface planar dfs8910 tool was used to achieve a highly planar
   metal-polymer rdl surface, at potentially lower costs than
   chemical-mechanical polishing that has been used in prior work. the
   processes discussed in this paper will enable routing of fine copper
   traces on panel-based interposers and hdfos at higher throughput and
   potentially lower costs than beol processes. a two-metal layer, 20-mu m
   io pitch silicon-like rdl test vehicle was fabricated with 2.5-mu m-wide
   and 2.5-mu m-space embedded traces and integrated with 2-mu m-diameter
   microvias using if4605 on glass. there was no pad in the integration.
   this pad-less structure can be used for achieving theoretically maximum
   interconnect density. the process flow emulates the salient features of
   damascene processes used for beol rdl on semiconductor wafers, but
   simplifies them using dry film polymer materials and panel processes.
   hence, it is referred to as organic embedded trace damascene or
   simplified as an organic damascene process (odp) in this paper. the
   novel odp interconnect addresses the current limitations of both sap and
   beol processes. the key highlights of this new odp technology are: 1) io
   densities of 200 io/mm/layer or more; 2) via-to-via pitch of 20 mu m or
   less; 3) high ar of routing traces in the range of 2-4; 4) precise rdl
   linewidth control; 5) double-sided process with glass core; and 6)
   reduced number of process steps and panel-scalability leading to lower
   fabrication costs.}},

   objective of this research was to develop a one-lead electrocardiogram
   (ecg) patch monitor for the detection of heartbeats and the calculation
   of frequency-domain parameters (as a mental index) of heart rate
   variability in real time. consisting of a microcontroller with arm 3
   core and embedded with a three-axis accelerometer, this monitor could
   real time provide some additional information related to user's daily
   physical activities. main specification items of the ecg patch monitor
   were found to meet the standards of the international electrotechnical
   commission for medical electrical equipment and ambulatory
   electrocardiography systems (holter ecg system). its ingress protection
   rating, for instance, was found to be 68 degrees. thus, the ecg patch
   monitor allowed users to put it on all day, and to do various kinds of
   exercises or sports, even including swimming. in order to let users feel
   comfortable, it was designed to be of light weight and could run for
   over 24 h. a 4 gb flash memory was installed in the apparatus for data
   storage. the performance of the heartbeat detection algorithm was
   evaluated by using the mit-bih arrhythmia database. the results showed a
   sensitivity of 99.7\% and a positive predictivity of 99.0\% for the
   cardiac rhythm detection. meanwhile, a mobile application algorithm
   allowed users to adjust some functions of the ecg patch monitor and to
   display the heart rate, mental index, and physical activities in 1 day.
   when users felt chest discomfort, they could push a button on the ecg
   patch monitor and 1-min ecg signals would be sent to the mobile device
   via bluetooth 4.0. based on the testing results, the patch-based ecg
   apparatus may be suitable for different types of users to apply in a
   ubiquitous healthcare environment, especially for those with a potential

   the way society accesses the health care industry. however, despite the
   widespread use of mobile health apps by patients in china, there has
   been little research that evaluates the effect of mobile health apps on
   patient experience during hospital visits.
   objective: the purpose of our study was to examine whether the use of
   mobile health apps improves patient experience and to find out the
   difference in patient experience between users and nonusers and the
   characteristics associated with the users of these apps.
   methods: we used the chinese outpatient experience questionnaire to
   survey patient experience. a sample of 300 outpatients was randomly
   selected from 3 comprehensive public hospitals (3 tertiary hospitals) in
   hubei province, china. each hospital randomly selected 50 respondents
   from mobile health app users and 50 from nonusers. a chi-square test was
   employed to compare the different categorical characteristics between
   mobile health app users and nonusers. a t test was used to test the
   significance in continuous variables between user scores and nonuser
   scores. multiple linear regression was conducted to determine whether
   the use of mobile health apps during hospital visits was associated with
   patient experience.
   results: the users and nonusers differed in age (chi(2)(2)= 12.2, p=.
   002), education (chi(2)(3)= 9.3, p=. 03), living place (chi(2)(1)= 7.7,
   p=. 006), and the need for specialists (chi(2)(4)= 11.0, p=. 03).
   compared with nonusers, mobile health app users in china were younger,
   better educated, living in urban areas, and had higher demands for
   specialists. in addition, mobile health app users gave significantly
   higher scores than nonusers in total patient experience scores (t(298)=
   3.919, p<. 001), the 18 items and the 5 dimensions of physician-patient
   communication (t(298)= 2.93, p=. 004), health information (t(298)=
   3.556, p<. 001), medical service fees (t(298)= 3.991, p<. 001),
   short-term outcome (t(298)= 4.533, p<. 001), and general satisfaction
   (t(298)= 4.304, p<. 001). multiple linear regression results showed that
   the use of mobile health apps during hospital visits influenced patient
   experience (t(289)= 3.143, p=. 002). after controlling for other
   factors, it was shown that the use of mobile health apps increased the
   outpatient experience scores by 17.7\%. additional results from the
   study found that the self-rated health status (t(289)= 3.746, p<. 001)
   and monthly income of patients (t(289)= 2.416, p=. 02) influenced the
   patient experience as well.
   conclusions: the use of mobile health apps could improve patient
   experience, especially with regard to accessing health information,
   making physician-patient communication more convenient, ensuring
   transparency in medical charge, and ameliorating short-term outcomes.
   all of these may contribute to positive health outcomes. therefore, we
   should encourage the adoption of mobile health apps in health care
   settings so as to improve patient experience.}},

   methodology. we searched pubmed, cinahl plus, embase, acm, and ieee
   xplore. in order to include ongoing clinical trials, we also searched
   clinicaltrials.gov. two investigators evaluated the retrieved articles
   for inclusion. discrepancies between investigators regarding article
   inclusion and extracted data were resolved through team discussion.
   results: 356 articles were screened and 24 were selected for review. the
   most common publication venue was in conference proceedings (13, 54\%).
   the majority of studies were published or presented in 2015 (19, 79\%).
   we identified two registered clinical trials underway. a large
   proportion of the identified studies focused on applications involving
   health monitoring for the elderly (6, 25\%). five studies focused on
   patients with parkinson's disease and one on cardiac arrest. there were
   no studies which reported use of usability testing before
   implementation.
   discussion: most of the reviewed studies focused on the chronically ill
   elderly. there was a lack of detailed description of user-centered
   design or usability testing before implementation. based on our review,
   the most commonly used platform in healthcare research was that of the
   android wear. the clinical application of smart watches as assistive
   devices deserves further attention.
   conclusion: smart watches are unobtrusive and easy to wear. while smart
   watch technology supplied with biosensors has potential to be useful in
   a variety of healthcare applications, rigorous research with their use

   the adoption of automatic fall detection mechanisms can noticeably
   reduce the response time of the medical staff or caregivers when a fall
   takes place. smartphones are being increasingly proposed as wearable,
   cost-effective and not-intrusive systems for fall detection. the
   exploitation of smartphones' potential (and in particular, the android
   operating system) can benefit from the wide implantation, the growing
   computational capabilities and the diversity of communication interfaces
   and embedded sensors of these personal devices. after revising the
   state-of-the-art on this matter, this study develops an experimental
   testbed to assess the performance of different fall detection algorithms
   that ground their decisions on the analysis of the inertial data
   registered by the accelerometer of the smartphone. results obtained in a
   real testbed with diverse individuals indicate that the accuracy of the
   accelerometry-based techniques to identify the falls depends strongly on
   the fall pattern. the performed tests also show the difficulty to set
   detection acceleration thresholds that allow achieving a good trade-off
   between false negatives (falls that remain unnoticed) and false
   positives (conventional movements that are erroneously classified as
   falls). in any case, the study of the evolution of the battery drain
   reveals that the extra power consumption introduced by the android
   monitoring applications cannot be neglected when evaluating the autonomy
   and even the viability of fall detection systems.}},

   and mobile applications have emerged to provide significant improvements
   in quality control and automation of the drying process. this research
   seeks to improve the performance of a recently developed, novel wireless
   probe for sensing temperature and moisture content of rice. the specific
   objective is to test the accuracy and precision of the measurements over
   a wide range of rice temperature (20 degrees c to 60 degrees c),
   moisture content (13\% to 25\% wet basis), and dockage levels (0 to 10\%
   by weight). wireless probes designed and built in collaboration with
   deacon technologies llc were used in this study. the probes were
   calibrated against thermocouple readings for temperature measurements
   and standard oven method measurements for moisture content. experiments
   were performed in triplicates using three different probes and three
   metal containers with rice samples to check the accuracy of the probes
   and to determine the variability amongst different probes. the probes
   were accurate due to the strong regressions found between the measured
   and true values of temperature and moisture content. the anova analysis
   showed that there was no significant difference within different probes
   both for temperature (p = 0.17) and moisture content (p = 0.48)
   measurements. calibration equations were developed to further reduce the
   variance in the probe measurements. both for temperature and moisture
   content measurements, the calibration equation coefficients were
   statistically significant with positive slopes and small standard errors
   (less than 0.5). thus, these probes could be handy for on-farm in-bin
   rice temperature and moisture monitoring; with the merits of
   portability, easy set-up and tear down, low initial and maintenance

  abstract       = {{background: one barrier to effectively treating weight issues among
   adolescents is that they tend to use social comparison instead of
   objective measures to evaluate their own health status. when adolescents
   correctly perceive themselves as overweight, they are more likely to
   adopt healthy lifestyle behaviors.
   objective: the purpose of this pilot test was to develop and assess
   acceptability and usability of an avatar-based, theoretically derived
   mobile app entitled monitor your avatar (mya).
   methods: the mya app was engineered for high school adolescents to
   identify, using avatars, what they thought they looked like, what they
   wanted to look like, and what they actually looked like based on body
   measurements.
   results: the mya app was pilot-tested with male and female adolescents
   aged 15-18 years to assess for acceptability and usability. a total of
   42 students created and viewed their avatars. the majority of the
   adolescents were female (28/42, 67\%), age 16 years (16/42, 38\%), white
   (35/42, 83\%), non-hispanic (36/42, 86\%), in grade 10 (20/42, 48\%),
   healthy weight for females (23/28, 82\%), and obese for males (7/14,
   50\%). the adolescents had positive reactions to the avatar app and
   being able to view avatars that represented them. all but one student
   (41/42, 98\%) indicated some level of comfort viewing the avatars and
   would use the app in the future to see how their bodies change over
   time.
   conclusions: avatar-based mobile apps, such as the mya app, provide
   immediate feedback and allow users to engage with images that are
   personalized to represent their perceptions and actual body images. this
   pilot study adds to the increasing but limited research of using games
   to improve health outcomes among high school adolescents. there is a
   need to further adapt the mya app and gather feedback from a larger
   number of high school adolescents, including those from diverse
   backgrounds.}},

  abstract             = {{field sampling is an essential step for digital soil mapping and various
   sampling strategies have been designed for achieving desirable mapping
   results. some unpredictable complex circumstances in the field, however,
   often prevent some samples from being collected based on the
   pre-designed sampling strategies. such circumstances include
   inaccessibility of some locations, change of land surface types, and
   heavily-disturbed soil at some locations, among others. this may result
   in the missing of some essential samples, which could impact the quality
   of digital soil mapping. previous studies have attempted to design
   alternative samples for the selected ones beforehand to address this
   issue. it cannot solve the problem completely as those pre-designed
   alternative samples could also be inaccessible. in this paper, we
   propose a dynamic method to recommend alternative samples for those
   unavailable samples in the field. the identification of alternative
   samples is based on the environmental similarity between an unavailable
   soil sample and its alternative candidates, as well as the spatial
   accessibility of these candidates. for the convenience of fieldwork, the
   proposed method was implemented to be a mobile application on the
   android platform. a simulated soil sampling study in xuancheng county,
   anhui province of china was used to evaluate its performance. from a
   sample set for the study are, 30 samples were assumed to be
   inaccessible. for each of them, an alternative soil sample from the set
   was recommended using the proposed method. a deviation analysis of silt
   and sand content at the depth of 20 \~{} 40 cm between the soil samples
   and their alternatives shows that the deviation on silt content is less
   than 20\% for half of the soil samples. a larger deviation on sand
   content might be attribute to the limited alternative candidates in this
   virtual experiment. in a second experiment, we randomly selected a
   number of existing soil samples and replaced them with their
   corresponding alternative soil samples. this created 1000 hybrid sample
   sets. each hybrid sample set was then used for digital soil mapping with
   ipsm. an evaluation using 59 independent soil samples indicated that the
   rmse and mae with the hybrid sample sets were close to that with the
   original sample set. the proposed method proved to be able to recommend
   effective alternative samples for those unavailable samples in the

  abstract  = {{identifying and examining the change-prone parts of the software is
   gaining wide importance in the field of software engineering. this would
   help software practitioners to cautiously assign the resources for
   testing and maintenance. software metrics can be used for constructing
   various classification models which allow timely identification of
   change prone classes. there have been various machine learning
   classification models proposed in the literature. however, due to
   varying results across studies, more research needs to be done to
   increase the confidence in the results and provide a valuable
   conclusion. in this paper, we have used a number of data analysis
   techniques (14 machine learning techniques and a statistical technique)
   to construct change prediction models and performed statistical testing
   to compare the performance of these models. the application of a large
   number of techniques will allow for fair evaluation and will thus,
   increase the conclusion validity of the study. the results are validated
   on five releases of an open source, widely used operating system in
   mobile phone and tablet computers, `android'. to make the results more
   generalizable, we have also conducted inter-release and cross-project
   predictions. the results conclude that the machine learning techniques
   are effective in predicting change prone classes and thus, should be
   widely used by researchers and practitioners to reduce maintenance
   effort and thus efficient and better development of software.}},

  abstract             = {{background: walking is a complex cognitive motor task that is commonly
   completed while performing another task such as talking or making
   decisions. gait assessments performed under normal and ``dual-task{''}
   walking conditions thus provide important insights into health. such
   assessments, however, are limited primarily to laboratory-based
   settings.
   objective: the objective of our study was to create and test a
   smartphone-based assessment of normal and dual-task walking for use in
   nonlaboratory settings.
   methods: we created an iphone app that used the phone's motion sensors
   to record movements during walking under normal conditions and while
   performing a serial-subtraction dual task, with the phone placed in the
   user's pants pocket. the app provided the user with multimedia
   instructions before and during the assessment. acquired data were
   automatically uploaded to a cloud-based server for offline analyses. a
   total of 14 healthy adults completed 2 laboratory visits separated by 1
   week. on each visit, they used the app to complete three 45-second
   trials each of normal and dual-task walking. kinematic data were
   collected with the app and a gold-standard instrumented gaitrite mat.
   participants also used the app to complete normal and dual-task walking
   trials within their homes on 3 separate days. within laboratory-based
   trials, gaitrite-derived heel strikes and toe-offs of the phone-side leg
   aligned with smartphone acceleration extrema, following filtering and
   rotation to the earth coordinate system. we derived stride times a
   clinically meaningful metric of locomotor control from gaitrite and app
   data, for all strides occurring over the gaitrite mat. we calculated
   stride times and the dual-task cost to the average stride time (ie,
   percentage change from normal to dual-task conditions) from both
   measurement devices. we calculated similar metrics from home-based app
   data. for these trials, periods of potential turning were identified via
   custom -developed algorithms and omitted from stride-time analyses.
   results: across all detected strides in the laboratory, stride times
   derived from the app and gaitrite mat were highly correlated (p<.001,
   r(2)=.98). these correlations were independent of walking condition and
   pocket tightness. app- and gaitrite-derived stride-time dual-task costs
   were also highly correlated (p<.001, r(2)=.95). the error of app-derived
   stride times (mean 16.9, sd 9.0 ms) was unaffected by the magnitude of
   stride time, walking condition, or pocket tightness. for both normal and
   dual-task trials, average stride times derived from app walking trials
   demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability within and between both
   laboratory and home-based assessments (intraclass correlation
   coefficient range .82-.94).
   conclusions: the iphone app we created enabled valid and reliable
   assessment of stride timing-with the smartphone in the pocket during
   both normal and dual-task walking and within both laboratory and
   nonlaboratory environments. additional work is warranted to expand the
   functionality of this tool to older adults and other patient
   populations.}},

   computing resources, where the processing power was moved from user's
   side to centralize server's side. many of desktop virtualization
   initiatives considered as fail because it run smooth during trial, but
   facing bottlenecks during real-life operation. not surprising, since
   during trial, we dealt only with very small quantity of vms, compared
   with production. some enterprise solution with focus on storage
   performance has proposed full-flash storage solution, but for small to
   medium scale organization that had budget constrains may prefer das

   and nas had limitation in performance compared with san, then some
   vendors offer server-side caching solution for virtualization that
   utilize ram (random access memory) or flash drive to leverage the
   storage performance. this experimental test was conducted to evaluate
   das and nas from two perspectives (performance and initial-investment
   cost), using iometer as workload simulator and benchmark tools for five
   storage scenarios, all configured in raid10 and using server-side
   caching as storage accelerator. this experimental test also intended to
   answer which storage approach (between das and nas) that most suitable
   with abc's requirement, abc was a university located in jakarta. three
   scenarios from das-based approach, labeled as sas7.2k, sas10k, sas15k,
   and two other scenarios from nas-based approach was labeled as
   nas1-7.2k, and nas2-7.2k. when talked about performance, we focused on
   three critical parameters (iops, bandwidth and latency). while sas15k
   (das-based) and nas2-7.2k (nas-based) were the top performer from each
   respective category, the author found that nas2-7.2k was the best
   option, it outperformed sas15k that 9,11\% higher in price. nas2-7.2k

  abstract             = {{background: despite advances in testing and treatment, hiv incidence
   rates within european countries are at best stable or else increasing.
   mhealth technology has been advocated to increase quality and
   cost-effectiveness of health services while dealing with growing patient
   numbers. however, studies suggested that mhealth apps are rarely adopted
   and often considered to be of low quality by users. only a few studies
   (conducted in the united states) have involved people living with hiv
   (plwh) in the design of mhealth.
   objective: the goal of this study was to facilitate a co-design process
   among plwh and clinicians across 5 clinical sites in the european union
   to inform the development of an mhealth platform to be integrated into
   clinical care pathways. we aimed to (1) elicit experiences of living
   with hiv and of working in hiv care, (2) identify mhealth
   functionalities that are considered useful for hiv care, and (3)
   identify potential benefits as well as concerns about mhealth.
   methods: between january and june 2016, 14 co-design workshops and 22
   semistructured interviews were conducted, involving 97 plwh and 63
   clinicians. data were analyzed thematically and iteratively, drawing on
   grounded theory techniques.
   results: findings were established into 3 thematic clusters: (1)
   approaching the mhealth platform, (2) imagining the mhealth platform,
   and (3) anticipating the mhealth platform's implications. co-design
   participants approached the mhealth platform with pre-existing concerns
   arising from their experiences of receiving or providing care. plwh
   particularly addressed issues of stigma and questioned how mhealth could
   enable them to manage their hiv. clinicians problematized the
   compatibility of mhealth with existing information technology systems
   and questioned which patients should be targeted by mhealth. imagining
   the potential of mhealth for hiv care, co-design participants suggested
   medical functionalities (accessing test results, managing medicines and
   appointments, and digital communication channels), social
   functionalities (peer support network, international travel, etc), and
   general features (security and privacy, credibility, language, etc).
   co-design participants also anticipated potential implications of
   mhealth for self-management and the provision of care.
   conclusions: our approach to co-design enabled us to facilitate early
   engagement in the mhealth platform, enabling patient and clinician
   feedback to become embedded in the development process at a preprototype
   phase. although the technologies in question were not yet present,
   understanding how users approach, imagine, and anticipate technology
   formed an important source of knowledge and proved highly significant
   within the technology design and development process.}},

   nutrition-related outcomes and for estimating the dietary change in
   nutrition-based interventions. when researching the habitual consumption
   of selected food groups, it is essential to be aware of factors that
   could possibly affect reporting accuracy.
   objective: this study aimed to evaluate the relative validity of the
   current-day dietary recall, a method based on a smartphone app called
   electronic 12-hour dietary recall (e-12hr), to categorize individuals
   according to habitual intake, in the whole sample of adults and in
   different strata thereof.
   methods: university students and employees over 18 years recorded the
   consumption of 10 selected groups of food using e-12hr during 28
   consecutive days. during this period, they also completed 4 dietary
   records. once the period was finished, the subjects then completed a
   food frequency questionnaire (ffq) and a usability-rating questionnaire
   for e-12hr. the food group intakes estimated by the e-12hr app, the
   dietary records, and the ffq were categorized into sextiles: less than
   once a week, once or twice a week, 3-4 times a week, 5-6 times a week,
   once or twice a day, and 3 or more times a day. the 10 selected groups
   with e-12hr were compared with 4 dietary records and an ffq reference
   method, in the whole sample and in different strata thereof: age
   (years): <25 and >= 25; gender: females and males; occupation: students
   and employees; smoking: no and yes; physical activity (minutes/week): >=
   150 and <150; and body mass index (kg/m(2)): <25 and >= 25. the
   association between the different methods was assessed using spearman
   correlation coefficient (scc). cross-classification and kappa statistic
   were used as a measure of agreement between the different methods.
   results: in total, 203 participants completed the study (56.7\%
   {[}115/203] women, and 43.3\% {[}88/203] men). for all food groups and
   all participants, the mean scc for e-12hr versus ffq was 0.67 (>= 0.62
   for all strata). on average, 50.7\% of participants were classified into
   the same category (>= 47.0\% for all strata) and 90.2\% within the
   nearest category (>= 88.6\% for all strata). mean weighted kappa was
   0.49 (>= 0.44 for all strata). for e-12hr versus rds, mean scc was 0.65
   (>= 0.57 for all strata). on average, 50.0\% of participants were
   classified into the same category (>= 47.0\% for all strata) and 88.2\%
   within the nearest category (>= 86.1\% for all strata). mean weighted
   kappa was 0.50 (>= 0.44 for all strata).
   conclusions: the results indicate that e-12hr generated categories of
   dietary intake highly comparable with the 2 reference methods in the
   whole sample and in different strata thereof. the inclusion of
   photographs to facilitate estimation of the servings consumed generated
   correlation/agreement data between e-12hr and the ffq that were similar
   to a previous study using an older version of the app, which did not
   include photographs.}},

   methods: a total of 74 adolescents aged 13 to 16 years from spain,
   italy, and the united kingdom participated in the co-design of the
   pegaso f4f technology. in 3 iterative cycles over 12 months,
   participants were involved in the co-design, refinement, and feasibility
   testing of a system consisting of diverse mobile apps with a variety of
   functions and facilities to encourage healthy weight-promoting
   behaviors. in the first iteration, participants attended a single
   workshop session and were presented with mock-ups or early-version
   prototypes of different apps for user requirements assessment and
   review. during the second iteration, prototypes of all apps were tested
   by participants for 1 week at home or school. in the third iteration,
   further developed prototypes were tested for 2 weeks. participants' user
   experience feedback and development ideas were collected through focus
   groups and completion of questionnaires.
   results: for the pegaso f4f technology to be motivating and engaging,
   participants suggested that it should (1) allow personalization of the
   interface, (2) have age-appropriate and easy-to-understand language (of
   icons, labels, instructions, and notifications), (3) provide easily
   accessible tutorials on how to use the app or navigate through a game,
   (4) present a clear purpose and end goal, (5) have an appealing and
   self-explanatory reward system, (6) offer variation in gamified
   activities within apps and the serious game, and (7) allow to seek peer
   support and connect with peers for competitive activities within the
   technology.
   conclusions: incorporating adolescents' preferences, the pegaso f4f
   technology combines the functions of a self-monitoring, entertainment,
   advisory, and social support tool. this was the first study
   demonstrating that it is possible to develop a complex mobile
   phone-based technological system applying the principles of co-design to

   scenarios, such as public charging systems in a city, where the mobile
   device provides an authentication mechanism. a user interface was
   developed to visualize transactions, gather users' preferences, and
   handle power charging limitations due to the usage of a shared
   infrastructure. the developed approach was tested in a shared space with
   three evs using a charging infrastructure for a period of 3.5 months.}},

  abstract          = {{the dissemination of information in large organizations using
   noticeboards is both inefficient and ineffective due to the static,
   unreliable and limiting nature of the boards. noticeboards are
   constrained in terms of reach, poor feedback mechanisms and a general
   lack of security. posts can be tampered with by malicious people or even
   removed by competitors. due to their fixed nature, noticeboards also do
   not cater for context, meaning that a lot of posts are consumed outside
   of their actionable spaces. this research proposes a context aware
   noticeboard in which subscribers are able to receive, store or share
   notices based on their context and be in a better position to react or
   act on them accordingly. object oriented analysis and agile development
   methodologies were applied to develop a robust and dynamic, context
   aware android-based noticeboard application with an analytical backend
   for visualizations. the final prototype was tested for usability and
   functionality with usability and acceptance rates of more than 90\%.
   furthermore, we recommend that more services being hinged on ble and
   context awareness should be explored due to the success of the proposed
   solution. additionally, it is imperative that institutions migrate

   enterprise software eco-system, resulting in new security challenges.
   web services are strategic components used by wide variety of
   organizations for information exchange on the internet scale. the public
   deployments of mission critical apis opens up possibility of software
   bugs to be maliciously exploited. therefore, vulnerability
   identification in web services through static as well as dynamic
   analysis is a thriving and interesting area of research in academia,
   national security and industry.
   using owasp (open web application security project) web services
   guidelines, this paper discusses the challenges of existing standards,
   and reviews new techniques and tools to improve services security by
   detecting vulnerabilities. recent vulnerabilities like shellshock and
   heartbleed has shifted the focus of risk assessment to the application
   layer, which for majority of organization means public facing web
   services and web/mobile applications. restful services have now become
   the new service development paradigm normal; therefore soap centric
   standards such as xml encryption, xml signature, ws-security, and
   ws-secureconversation are nearly not as relevant.
   in this paper we provide an overview of the owasp top 10 vulnerabilities
   for web services, and discuss the potential static code analysis
   techniques to discover these vulnerabilities. the paper reviews the

   the amount to the mobility of the readers deployed, which in turn highly
   affects the quality of the rfid system, causing reading collisions.
   although several solutions were proposed to engage the issue of reading
   collision, few were ever concerned with the densification and/or
   mobility of readers. this paper proposes two distributed tdma (time
   division multiple access) approaches designed to reduce these collisions
   through local coordination between neighboring devices for different
   scenarios tested here. the first proposal is based on a reservation
   phase organized between readers with different priority levels given to
   readers depending on their previous success. the second one takes
   advantage of the particular case of rfid collisions, allowing a local
   and mutual decision of each reader to access or not tags in their
   vicinity. simulations were run over different stressful environments in
   terms of tag/reader density and mobility, proving that our proposals

   strengthening has been observed with increased strain rate for both sac

   in human life, particularly, handicapped and senior citizens. appliances
   automation allows users to control different appliances such as light,
   fan, fridge and ac. it also provides security system like door
   controlling, temperature \& fire detection and water shower.
   furthermore, security cameras are used to control and monitored by the
   users to observe activity around a house. it has been observed that the
   internet services in interior sindh are not as much better as required.
   hence, gsm sim900a based android application is developed named
   appliances automation \& security control system using arduino. the
   developed system is decomposed into two separate entities: (1) hardware
   is designed and developed using arduino (mega 2560) with other required
   electronics components which is programmed using embedded c language,
   (2) an android app which provides freedom to user to control and access
   the electronic appliances and the security system without internet. the
   developed application is tested in karachi, sukkur and khairpur with
   zong, moblink, telenor and ufone. the acceptable results are achieved at
   karachi and sukkur but suitable results are not calculated at khairpur
   in terms of delay due to the frequency of selected gsm module.}},

   significant impact on costs and time-to-market, or even make the

   for each type of application is a challenge that many developers are not

   applications executing in an mcc environment. we defined a methodology
   to create and validate deterministic and stochastic petri net (dspn)
   models to evaluate these three critical metrics. the dspns results were
   compared with results obtained through experiments performed on a
   testbed environment. we analyzed an image processing application,
   regarding connections type (wlan, wifi, and 3g), servers type (mcc or
   cloudlet), and functionalities performance. our numerical analyses
   indicate, for instance, that the use of a cloudlet significantly
   improves performance and energy efficiency. besides, the baseline
   scenario took us one month to implement, while modeling and evaluation
   the three scenarios required less than one day. in this way, our dspn

  abstract          = {{modern mobile apps use cloud-hosted http-based api services and heavily
   rely on the internet infrastructure for data communication and storage.
   to improve performance and leverage the power of the mobile device,
   input validation and other business logic required for interfacing with
   web api services are typically implemented on the mobile client.
   however, when a web service implementation fails to thoroughly replicate
   input validation, it gives rise to inconsistencies that could lead to
   attacks that can compromise user security and privacy. developing
   automatic methods of auditing web apis for security remains challenging.
   in this paper, we present a novel approach for automatically analyzing
   mobile app-to-web api communication to detect inconsistencies in input
   validation logic between apps and their respective web api services. we
   present our system, wardroid, which implements a static analysis-based
   web api reconnaissance approach to uncover inconsistencies on real world
   api services that can lead to attacks with severe consequences for
   potentially millions of users throughout the world. our system utilizes
   program analysis techniques to automatically extract http communication
   templates from android apps that encode the input validation constraints
   imposed by the apps on outgoing web requests to web api services.
   wardroid is also enhanced with blackbox testing of server validation
   logic to identify inconsistencies that can lead to attacks.
   we evaluated our system on a set of 10,000 popular free apps from the
   google play store. we detected problematic logic in apis used in over
   4,000 apps, including 1,743 apps that use unencrypted http
   communication. we further tested 1,000 apps to validate web api
   hijacking vulnerabilities that can lead to potential compromise of user
   privacy and security and found that millions of users are potentially
   affected from our sample set of tested apps.}},

   store star ratings and descriptions usually provide insufficient or even
   false information about app quality, although they are popular among end
   users. a rigorous systematic approach to establish and evaluate the
   quality of mhas is urgently needed. the mobile app rating scale (mars)
   is an assessment tool that facilitates the objective and systematic
   evaluation of the quality of mhas. however, a german mars is currently
   not available.
   objective: the aim of this study was to translate and validate a german
   version of the mars (mars-g).
   methods: the original 19-item mars was forward and backward translated
   twice, and the mars-g was created. app description items were extended,
   and 104 mhas were rated twice by eight independent bilingual
   researchers, using the mars-g and mars. the internal consistency,
   validity, and reliability of both scales were assessed. mokken scale
   analysis was used to investigate the scalability of the overall scores.
   results: the retranslated scale showed excellent alignment with the
   original mars. additionally, the properties of the mars-g were
   comparable to those of the original mars. the internal consistency was
   good for all subscales (ie, omega ranged from 0.72 to 0.91). the
   correlation coefficients (r) between the dimensions of the mars-g and
   mars ranged from 0.93 to 0.98. the scalability of the mars (h=0.50) and
   mars-g (h=0.48) were good.
   conclusions: the mars-g is a reliable and valid tool for experts and
   stakeholders to assess the quality of health apps in german-speaking
   populations. the overall score is a reliable quality indicator. however,
   further studies are needed to assess the factorial structure of the mars
   and mars-g.}},

   important task within the analysis of energy models. the representation
   of these models is especially important in urban areas, in which the
   under-standing of patterns of energy production and demand is key for an
   efficient city planning. location based services (lbs) provide a
   valuable addition towards the analysis and visualization of those data
   sets as the user can explore the output of different models and
   simulations in the real environment at the location of interest. towards
   this aim, the present research explores mobile alternatives to the
   visual analysis of temporal data series and 3d building models. based on
   the fields of numerical simulation, gis and computer graphics, this work
   presents a novel mobile service that allows exploring urban models at
   different level of details (lods) using well-known standards such as
   citygml. ultimately, the project enables researchers, city planners and
   technicians to explore urban energy datasets in an interactive and
   immersive manner as virtual globes, virtual reality and augmented
   reality. using models of the city of karlsruhe, the final service has
   been implemented and tested on the ios platform providing an empirical
   insight on the performance of the system. in addition, this research
   provides a holistic approach by developing one application that is
   capable of seamlessly change the visualization mode.}},

   in the paper, specifications and the characteristics of the component

   authors did some examination of the selected mobile systems to be
   applied for measuring the clearance gauge. the riegl (vmx-250) and z+f
   (zoller + frohlich) solution were tested. additional test measurements
   were carried out within a 30-kilometer section of the warsaw-krakow
   route. these measurements were designed so as to provide various
   elements of the railway infrastructure, the track geometry and the
   installed geodetic control network. this ultimately made it possible to
   reduce the time for the preparation of geodetic reference measurements
   for the testing of the accuracy of the selected systems. reference
   measurements included the use of the polar method to select profiles
   perpendicular to the axis of the track. in addition, the coordinates
   selected were well defined as measuring points of the objects of the
   infrastructure of the clearance gauge. all of the tested systems meet

   library knowledge acquisition, task performance, and the process of
   learning.
   design - the main experiment included a pretest, learning experience,
   post-test, and a questionnaire. one month later, a post-experiment was
   conducted, including a test of ``declarative knowledge{''} and a
   behavioural test.
   setting - kyushu university in fukuoka, japan.
   subjects - 36 first-year undergraduate students, of which 25 were female
   and 11 were male. students were divided into experimental and control
   groups. 32 students completed the study.
   methods - in the main experiment, students responded to the same 20
   question pre-test on library use, and then both groups participated in
   learning experiences designed to convey knowledge about using the
   library. the control group's learning setting was a web-based tutorial
   about the library. the experimental group's learning setting was
   ``library adventures: unveil the hidden mysteries!{''} a ``game-based
   learning environment{''} developed by the researchers (kaneko, saito,
   nohara, kudo, \& yamada, 2015, p. 404), which required students to
   complete activities by physically moving through the library. for both
   groups, learning content related to local library procedures, like
   hours, arrangement of collections, and methods for locating books and
   articles. the game collected data that the authors analyzed using
   statistical methods in an attempt to validate quizzes that were embedded
   in the game. after finishing the learning experience, all students
   completed the 20-question post-test, and then responded to the
   instructional materials motivation survey (imms), a questionnaire
   designed to gauge learning motivation using the attention, relevance,
   confidence, and satisfaction (arcs) model. one month following the main
   experiment, all students took a test of declarative knowledge and
   completed a skills test.
   main results - experimental and control group students gained about the
   same level of declarative knowledge. all students lost some knowledge in
   the one-month gap between the main and post-experiment. students who had
   learned through library adventure were able to borrow a journal and
   locate a newspaper article more effectively than the control group. in
   contrast, tutorial users made study room reservations more quickly than
   the experimental group. more significantly, the imms instrument
   demonstrated that game-based learners scored higher in attention,
   relevance, and satisfaction than tutorial-based learners. experimental
   and control group participants demonstrated the same level of
   confidence.
   conclusion - while inconclusive about the effectiveness of games versus
   tutorials for acquisition and retention of knowledge, the authors
   concluded that game-based instructional content may foster greater
   learner engagement, aiding some students in understanding how to use the
   library in a manner superior to web-based tutorials. librarians and
   instructional designers developing game-based learning experiences for
   novice library users may find this research informative.}},

   designed using a dspic 33fj256gp710 module, which allows an efficient
   local signal processing, potentially including morphological analysis

   management and local storage. the system is connected to a smart phone
   through a bluetooth module, which, on the one hand, allows to display
   and store the ecg signal in the smartphone, and on the other hand, also
   displays and transmits he ecg signal for remote diagnosis and patient
   history storage. the preliminary analysis of the system was carried out
   with data taken from the physionet dataset, in order to test its
   performance, in three different modalities. first, in the local mode, a
   recording time of over 120 hours has been achieved. second, in the
   cellular mode, up to 10 days of data could be stored in the phone. and
   third, in the remote server mode, practically unlimited time can be
   stored. for remote signal visualization, the average delay of the

   presence in people's everyday lives. they enable access to different
   information and services independent of current place and time. such
   widespread connectivity offers significant potential in different app
   areas including health care.
   objective: our goal was to evaluate the usability of the connect mobile
   app. the mobile app enables mobile access to the connect system, an
   online system that supports cancer patients in managing health-related
   issues. along with symptom management, the system promotes better
   patient-provider communication, collaboration, and shared decision
   making. the connect mobile app enables access to the connect system over
   both mobile phones and tablets.
   methods: the study consisted of usability tests of a high fidelity
   prototype with 7 cancer patients where the objectives were to identify
   existing design and functionality issues and to provide patients with a
   real look-and-feel of the mobile system. in addition, we conducted
   semistructured interviews to obtain participants-feedback about app
   usefulness, identify the need for new system features and design
   requirements, and measure the acceptance of the mobile app and its
   features within everyday health management.
   results: the study revealed a total of 27 design issues (13 for mobile
   apps and 14 for tablet apps), which were mapped to source events (ie,
   errors, requests for help, participants-concurrent feedback, and
   moderator observation). we also applied usability heuristics to identify
   violations of usability principles. the majority of violations were
   related to enabling ease of input, screen readability, and glanceability
   (15 issues), as well as supporting an appropriate match between systems
   and the real world (7 issues) and consistent mapping of system functions
   and interactions (4 issues). feedback from participants also showed the
   cancer patients-requirements for support systems and how these needs are
   influenced by different context-related factors, such as type of access
   terminal (eg, desktop computer, tablet, mobile phone) and phases of
   illness. based on the observed results, we proposed design and
   functionality recommendations that can be used for the development of
   mobile apps for cancer patients to support their health management
   process.
   conclusions: understanding and addressing users-requirements is one of
   the main prerequisites for developing useful and effective
   technology-based health interventions. the results of this study outline
   different user requirements related to the design of the mobile patient
   support app for cancer patients. the results will be used in the
   iterative development of the connect mobile app and can also inform
   other developers and researchers in development, integration, and
   evaluation of mobile health apps and services that support cancer
   patients in managing their health-related issues.}},

  abstract             = {{sudden accident in factories causes huge damage to human life and
   property which is a serious problem. the fire incident of baldia town
   factory karachi, pakistan on september 11, 2012, took precious lives of
   approximately 259 workers. in order to overcome such catastrophe, a
   reliable system based on wireless sensor network (wsn) is proposed. the
   wsns are considered as emerging, reliable and advantageous technologies
   due to their self-configuring and self-organizing capabilities. sensors
   are integrated to collect the required data. the system not only
   monitors catastrophe inside the factory but also generate alerts at the
   same instant to the nearby places (i.e. residential areas, schools
   etc.). the sole purpose is to inform the workers (working inside the
   factory) and people (residing within factory premises) about the worst
   situation and hence save their lives. the proposed work revolves around
   two scenarios of system deployment. first is using fixed monitoring
   nodes and other is using mobile monitoring nodes. the prototype is
   firstly tested within the normal environment, secondly, with high
   intensity of the fire, and thirdly when the intensity of fire is kept
   low. it is evident from the graphs that the readings are continuously
   being updated not only on the display (receiver node) placed at the
   emergency center within the factory but on the web page as well and it
   then generates various emergency notifications via android application,
   web page and sms. graphs taken under different environments also show
   that the alarms are generated as soon as the readings cross threshold
   levels indicates catastrophe. to the best of our knowledge, no such
   system is available in the market which is generating alerts using
   multiple ways, hence makes the proposed system more authenticated. for
   mobile node scenario, this work deals with the fundamental challenge of
   wireless sensor networks i.e. node localization which describes that the
   readings obtained from a node must define the position where it is
   deployed. therefore, localization technique is also introduced for
   catastrophe monitoring system. location of nodes can make rapid
   responses to encounter the catastrophe before it reaches the intensity.
   rssi based trilateration and centroid algorithm is introduced to find
   the location of nodes.}},

  abstract  = {{purpose - this paper aims to present a research outcome to an
   investigation towards the innovative use of electronic-learning
   (e-learning) software solutions to strengthen the interactive component
   of mobile learning (m-learning) in university contexts. this work was
   motivated by observations of interactive limitations in existing
   m-learning solutions in well-intentioned software development and
   e-learning efforts. the aim of the project, thus, was to interrogate
   hindrances to the potency of m-learning interventions. the idea was to
   strengthen the interactive component, to improve the compatibility of
   the desktop e-learning process - with mobile appliances such as mobile
   phones and, finally, to explore cost minimizing avenues of downloading
   learning materials over mobile phones.
   design/methodology/approach - the methodology of the project was
   twofold: that is, both literature-based and experimental. literature
   background offered insight on existing efforts towards interactive
   m-learning solutions. against this background, the project was then
   designed to explore ways to provide presentations and interactive chats
   for effective m-learning over mobile phones. the idea was to reduce the
   file size of presentations slides for effective display on mobile
   devices. finally, the aim was also to minimize airtime costs when
   transmitting presentation slides and when conducting interactive chats
   on mobile phones. an experiment research method was, thus, used. in this
   method, a problem and question were articulated first. then, a practical
   technological solution was conceptualized, developed, pre-tested,
   modified and re-tested until it complied with sought specifications,
   finally, the solution was implemented, to confirm its viability and
   response to a research problem and, ultimately, was reported in the
   findings.
   findings - slides were developed with light colour resolutions to open
   effortlessly on tiny mobile screens. the best quality was between 128
   and 201.188 (out of 255) pixels (more visible mobile phone screens),
   using open source software. clear slides also had a font greater than
   size 32. the average data per presentation were 9,872.66 bytes, and,
   when seven learners were chatting, it was 3,686.63 bytes (0.03
   megabytes). for airtime costs, the vodacom rate of r0.46 per megabyte
   was used. this translates to 0.8 x 0.46 = r0.0368 cost per slide. the
   m-chisimba platform therefore, seems to be cost-effective, quality
   expedient and most appropriate for interactive m-learning.
   research limitations/implications - existing m-learning has been
   inadequate, failing to align adequately the desktop e-learning solutions
   with mobile phone platforms. desktop presentation slides, for example,
   have been incompatible with mobile phones' operations and screen sizes.
   mostly, content could consume a lot more airtime, owing to large sizes
   of desktop originated material that was incompatible with mobile
   platforms. a solution that emerged from original experiments, leading to
   the enhanced interactive m-learning solution, the m-chisimba platform,
   is, therefore, presented in this paper. the thinking is that mobile
   applications are convenient enablers which extend access to information.
   nevertheless, mobile applications (including m-learning solutions)
   cannot be seen as panaceas to solve all learning concerns as literacy
   and affordability remain challenges in many under-developed social
   environments. as a newly developed innovation, the m-chisimba platform
   offers an improved m-learning solution for learning activities over
   mobile gadgets such as mobile phones.
   practical implications - the research work offers new innovative
   solutions in a number of practical ways. it improves the interactivity
   component of the m-learning process, to empower educators and learners
   to effectively engage learning over m-learning devices.
   social implications - the innovation makes it easier to for learning to
   take place effortlessly, over mobile platforms. implications are that
   more people will be able to access learning processes on the move,
   meaning that obstacles to access learning opportunities are minimised.
   originality/value - existing m-learning has been inadequate, failing to
   align adequately the desktop e-learning solutions with mobile phone
   platforms. desktop presentation slides, for example, have been
   incompatible with mobile phones' operations and screen sizes. mostly,
   content could consume a lot more airtime, owing to large sizes of
   desktop-originated material that was incompatible with mobile-platforms.

   filters, such as better stability and precision. according to the
   duration/length of the impulse response, digital filters are categorized
   as finite-impulse-response (fir) and infinite-impulse-response (iir)
   filters. because the error surface of iir filters is mostly multimodal,
   powerful global optimization techniques are preferred for avoid local
   minima in the filter design process. artificial intelligence (ai)-based
   approaches, swarm intelligence (si) and evolutionary computation (ec)
   techniques are candidate methods to address this problem and to produce
   desirable solutions. si is used to model the collective behavior of
   social swarms in nature, such as ant colonies, honey bees, and bird
   flocks. the ec is based on the principle of evolution (survival of the
   fittest). in this paper, a novel index for iir filter design is
   introduced (called ``indicator of success{''}) and si and ec algorithms
   are tested and evaluated for several numbers of novel and conventional
   heuristic algorithms. the reduced-order identification of two
   benchmarked iir plants are carried out. we analyzed the performance of
   the proposed algorithms in iir digital filters design in terms of the

   management system (asyms) has been developed to facilitate the remote
   monitoring and management of chemotherapy-related toxicity in patients
   with cancer, using patient-reported outcomes questionnaires and a
   clinician alerting system.
   objective: this study aims to evaluate the usability of the asyms, a
   mobile phone-based technology, from the perspective of canadian patients
   with cancer receiving chemotherapy to identify existing design,
   functionality, and usability issues and elicit their views, experiences,
   and satisfaction with the asyms.
   methods: we used a mixed-method approach to data collection with
   user-based testing, a think-aloud technique, semistructured interviews,
   and short answer questionnaires with a purposive sample of 10 patients
   with cancer. participants attended usability testing sessions at the
   centre for global ehealth innovation, university health network, and
   performed specific tasks on the asyms device. the test was videorecorded
   and each task was timed during the test. after the usability sessions,
   participants completed a posttest questionnaire and participated in a
   semistructured qualitative interview. a thematic analysis was used to
   code and categorize the identified issues into themes that summarized
   the type and frequency of occurrence.
   results: the thematic analysis generated 3 overarching themes as
   follows: asyms user-friendliness; usefulness of asyms (content quality
   and richness); and intention to use. results from the posttest
   questionnaire indicated that 80\% (8/10) of participants had great
   motivation to use the asyms, 70\% (7/10) had positive perceptions of the
   successful use of the asyms, and all (10/10, 100\%) had a positive
   attitude toward using the asyms in the future. most identified design
   and functionality issues were related to the navigation of the asyms
   device and a desire for a more attractive design with advanced
   functionality and features. the main general design recommendations were
   as follows: enhance the readability of the screen; implement advance
   options (eg, search option); and support better navigation.

   outcomes.
   objective: the aim of this study was to design, develop, and assess the
   utilization of an asthma collaborative self-management (csm) platform
   (breathe) using content based on international evidence-based clinical
   guidelines.
   methods: we designed and developed breathe as a web-based mobile health
   (mhealth) platform accessible on smartphones, tablets, or desktop with
   user-centered design methods and international organization for
   standardization-certified quality development processes. moreover,
   breathe was envisioned as a multifunctional, csm mhealth platform, with
   content based on international clinical practice guidelines and
   compliant with national privacy and security specifications. the system
   enabled csm (patient, provider, and breathe) and self-monitoring of
   asthma patients through (1) assessment of asthma control, (2) real-time
   access to a dynamic asthma action plan, (3) access to real-time
   environmental conditions, and (4) risk-reduction messaging. the data
   collection protocol collected user data for 12 months, with clinic
   visits at baseline and 6 and 12 months. utilization outcomes included
   user interactions with the platform, user impressions, self-reported
   medication use, asthma symptom profile, reported peak flow measurement,
   and the delivery and impact of email reminders.
   results: we enrolled 138 patients with a mean age of 45.3 years to
   receive the breathe intervention. majority were female (100/138,
   72.5\%), had a smartphone (92/138, 66.7\%), and had a mean asthma
   control test score of 18.3 (sd 4.9). a majority reported that breathe
   helped in the management of their asthma. moreover, breathe scored 71.1
   (sd 18.9) on the system usability scale. overall, 123 patients had
   complete usage analytics datasets. the platform sent 7.96 reminder
   emails per patient per week (pppw), patients accessed breathe 3.08
   times, journaled symptoms 2.56 times, reported medication usage 0.30
   times, and reported peak flow measurements 0.92 times pppw. furthermore,
   breathe calculated patients' action plan zone of control 2.72 times
   pppw, with patients being in the green (well-controlled) zone in 47.71\%
   (8300/17,396) of the total calculations. usage analysis showed that
   67.5\% (83/123) of the participants used the app at week 4 and only
   57.7\% (71/123) by week 45. physician visits, email reminders, and aged
   50 years and above were associated with higher utilization.
   conclusions: individuals with asthma reported good usability and high
   satisfaction levels, reacted to breathe notifications, and had
   confidence in the platform's assessment of asthma control. strong
   utilization was seen at the intervention's initiation, followed by a
   rapid reduction in use. patient reminders, physician visits, and being

   materials and methods: thirty typodont tooth models (nissin) with pulp

   fiber post and cores. three different methods of scanning were used (n =
   10): an intraoral scanner (ios) (trios 3; 3shape) to directly digitalize
   the post space (group t) and a laboratory scanner to indirectly
   digitalize the resin pattern (group rp) and the silicone impression
   (group s) of the post space. all the specimens were examined using an
   optical microscope for the measurement of the vertical marginal
   discrepancy (vmd), and five in each group were scanned using
   microcomputed tomography (mu ct) for the assessment of the vmd, the
   internal fit at the corner (ifc), post apex (pa), and at four horizontal
   cross-sections (cs1-4) inside the canal. all data were analyzed using
   mixed-design anova, followed by pairwise testing to identify the
   differences (a = 0.05).
   results: statistical analysis revealed that group t was associated with
   the smallest cement space compared with group rp (p = 0.001) and group s
   (p < 0.001) for vmd using mu ct or direct microscopy (om) (p < 0.001).
   similarly, the cement space for group t was smaller than that of group s
   (p = 0.039) when measured at the ifc (mu ct), and smaller than group rp
   (p = 0.025) when measured at cs1-4 (mu ct), with cs1 larger than cs3 (p

   conclusion: better adaptation was achieved with a complete digital
   workflow. scanning the resin pattern or the silicone impression

   confidentiality in health care and the opaqueness of transport security
   in apps make the latter an important research subject.
   objective: this study aimed to (1) identify relevant security concerns
   on the server side of mhealth apps, (2) test a subset of mhealth apps
   regarding their vulnerability to those concerns, and (3) compare the
   servers used by mhealth apps with servers used in all domains.
   methods: server security characteristics relevant to the security of
   mhealth apps were assessed, presented, and discussed. to evaluate
   servers, appropriate tools were selected. apps from the android and ios
   app stores were selected and tested, and the results for functional and
   other backend servers were evaluated.
   results: the 60 apps tested communicate with 823 servers. of these, 291
   were categorized as functional backend servers, and 44 (44/291, 15.1\%)
   of these received a rating below the a range (a+, a, and a-) by qualys
   ssl labs. a chi-square test was conducted against the number of servers
   receiving such ratings from ssl pulse by qualys ssl labs. it was found
   that the tested servers from mhealth apps received significantly fewer
   ratings below the a range (p<.001). the internationally available apps
   from the test set performed significantly better than those only
   available in the german stores (alpha=.05; p=.03). of the 60 apps, 28
   (28/60, 47\%) were found using at least one functional backend server
   that received a rating below the a range from qualys ssl labs,
   endangering confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of the data
   displayed. the number of apps that used at least one entirely unsecured
   connection was 20 (20/60, 33\%) when communicating with functional
   backend servers. it was also found that a majority of apps used
   advertising, tracking, or external content provider servers. when
   looking at all nonfunctional backend servers, 48 (48/60, 80\%) apps used
   at least one server that received a rating below the a range.
   conclusions: the results show that although servers in the mhealth
   domain perform significantly better regarding their security, there are
   still problems with the configuration of some. the most severe problems
   observed can expose patient communication with health care
   professionals, be exploited to display false or harmful information, or
   used to send data to an app facilitating further damage on the device.
   following the recommendations for mhealth app developers, the most
   regularly observed security issues can be avoided or mitigated.}},

  abstract             = {{background: mobile health (mhealth) apps show a growing importance for
   patients and health care professionals. apps in this category are
   diverse. some display important information (ie, drug interactions),
   whereas others help patients to keep track of their health. however,
   insufficient transport security can lead to confidentiality issues for
   patients and medical professionals, as well as safety issues regarding
   data integrity. mhealth apps should therefore deploy intensified
   vigilance to protect their data and integrity. this paper analyzes the
   state of security in mhealth apps.
   objective: the objectives of this study were as follows: (1)
   identification of relevant transport issues in mhealth apps, (2)
   development of a platform for test purposes, and (3) recommendation of
   practices to mitigate them.
   methods: security characteristics relevant to the transport security of
   mhealth apps were assessed, presented, and discussed. these
   characteristics were used in the development of a prototypical platform
   facilitating streamlined tests of apps. for the tests, six lists of the
   10 most downloaded free apps from three countries and two stores were
   selected. as some apps were part of these top 10 lists in more than one
   country, 53 unique apps were tested.
   results: out of the 53 apps tested from three european app stores for
   android and ios, 21/53 (40\%) showed critical results. all 21 apps
   failed to guarantee the integrity of data displayed. a total of 18 apps
   leaked private data or were observable in a way that compromised
   confidentiality between apps and their servers; 17 apps used unprotected
   connections; and two apps failed to validate certificates correctly.
   none of the apps tested utilized certificate pinning. many apps employed
   analytics or ad providers, undermining user privacy.
   conclusions: the tests show that many mhealth apps do not apply
   sufficient transport security measures. the most common security issue
   was the use of any kind of unprotected connection. some apps used secure
   connections only for selected tasks, leaving all other traffic
   vulnerable.}},

  abstract       = {{backgroundnew specific application domain (sad) heuristics or design
   principles are being developed to guide the design and evaluation of
   mobile applications in a bid to improve on the usability of these
   applications. this is because the existing heuristics are rather generic
   and are often unable to reveal a large number of mobile usability issues
   related to mobile specific interfaces and characteristics. mobile
   electronic data capturing forms (medcfs) are one of such applications
   that are being used to collect health data particularly in hard to reach
   areas, but with a number of usability challenges especially when used in
   rural areas by semi literate users. existing sad design principles are
   often not used to evaluate mobile forms because their focus on features
   specific to data capture is minimal. in addition, some of these lists
   are extremely long rendering them difficult to use during the design and
   development of the mobile forms. the main aim of this study therefore
   was to generate a usability evaluation checklist that can be used to
   design and evaluate mobile electronic data capturing forms in a bid to
   improve their usability. we also sought to compare the novice and expert
   developers' views regarding usability criteria.methodswe conducted a
   literature review in august 2016 using key words on articles and gray
   literature, and those with a focus on heuristics for mobile
   applications, user interface designs of mobile devices and web forms
   were eligible for review. the data bases included the acm digital
   library, ieee-xplore and google scholar. we had a total of 242 papers
   after removing duplicates and a total of 10 articles which met the
   criteria were finally reviewed. this review resulted in an initial
   usability evaluation checklist consisting of 125 questions that could be
   adopted for designing medcfs. the questions that handled the five main
   categories in data capture namely; form content, form layout, input
   type, error handling and form submission were considered. a validation
   study was conducted with both novice and expert developers using a
   validation tool in a bid to refine the checklist which was based on 5
   criteria. the criteria for the validation included utility, clarity,
   question naming, categorization and measurability, with utility and
   measurability having a higher weight respectively. we then determined
   the proportion of participants who agreed (scored 4 or 5), disagreed
   (scored 1 or 2) and were neutral (scored 3) to a given criteria
   regarding a particular question for each of the experts and novice
   developers. finally, we selected questions that had an average of 85\%
   agreement (scored 4 or 5) across all the 5 criteria by both novice and
   expert developers. agreement' stands for capturing the same views or
   sentiments about theperceived likeness of an evaluation
   question.resultsthe validation study reduced the initial 125 usability
   evaluation questions to 30 evaluation questions with the form layout
   category having the majority questions. results from the validation
   showed higher levels of affirmativeness from the expert developers
   compared to those of the novice developers across the different
   criteria; however the general trend of agreement on relevance of
   usability questionswas similar across all the criteria for the
   developers. the evaluation questions that were being validated were
   found to be useful, clear, properly named and categorized, however the
   measurability of the questions was found not to be satisfactory by both
   sets of developers.
   the developers attached great importance to the use of appropriate
   language and to the visibility of the help function, but in addition
   expert developers felt that indication of mandatory and optional fields
   coupled with the use of device information like the global positioning
   system (gps) was equally important. and for both sets of developers,
   utility had the highest scores while measurability scored
   least.conclusionthe generated checklist indicated the design features
   the software developers found necessary to improve the usability of
   mobile electronic data collection tools. in the future, we thus propose
   to test the effectiveness of the measure for suitability and performance
   based on this generated checklist, and test it on the end users (data
   collectors) with a purpose of picking their design requirements.
   continuous testing with the end users will help refine the checklist to
   include only that which is most important in improving the data
   collectors' experience.}},

  abstract       = {{background: mobile apps present a potentially cost-effective tool for
   delivering behavior change interventions at scale, but no known studies
   have tested the efficacy of apps as a tool to specifically increase
   vegetable consumption among overweight adults.
   objective: the purpose of this pilot study was to assess the initial
   efficacy and user acceptability of a theory-driven mobile app to
   increase vegetable consumption.
   methods: a total of 17 overweight adults aged 42.0 ( sd 7.3) years with
   a body mass index ( bmi) of 32.0 ( sd 3.5) kg/m(2) were randomized to
   the use of vegethon ( a fully automated theory-driven mobile app
   enabling self-monitoring of vegetable consumption, goal setting,
   feedback, and social comparison) or a wait-listed control condition. all
   participants were recruited from an ongoing 12-month weight loss trial (
   parent trial). researchers who performed data analysis were blinded to
   condition assignment. the primary outcome measure was daily vegetable
   consumption, assessed using an adapted version of the validated harvard
   food frequency questionnaire administered at baseline and 12 weeks after
   randomization. an analysis of covariance was used to assess differences
   in 12-week vegetable consumption between intervention and control
   conditions, controlling for baseline. app usability and satisfaction
   were measured via a 21-item post-intervention questionnaire.
   results: using intention-to-treat analyses, all enrolled participants (
   intervention: 8; control: 9) were analyzed. of the 8 participants
   randomized to the intervention, 5 downloaded the app and logged their
   vegetable consumption a mean of 0.7 ( sd 0.9) times per day, 2
   downloaded the app but did not use it, and 1 never downloaded it.
   consumption of vegetables was significantly greater among the
   intervention versus control condition at the end of the 12-week pilot
   study ( adjusted mean difference: 7.4 servings; 95\% ci 1.4-13.5; p=.
   02). among secondary outcomes defined a priori, there was significantly
   greater consumption of green leafy vegetables, cruciferous vegetables,
   and dark yellow vegetables ( adjusted mean difference: 2.6, 1.6, and 0.8
   servings; 95\% ci 0.1-5.0, 0.1-3.2, and 0.3-1.4; p=. 04, p=. 04, and p=.
   004, respectively). participants reported positive experiences with the
   app, including strong agreement with the statements `` i have found
   vegethon easy to use{''} and `` i would recommend vegethon to a
   friend{''} ( mean 4.6 ( sd 0.6) and 4.2 ( sd 0.8), respectively, ( on a
   5-point scale).
   conclusions: vegethon demonstrated initial efficacy and user
   acceptability. a mobile app intervention may be useful for increasing
   vegetable consumption among overweight adults. the small sample size
   prevented precise estimates of effect sizes. given the improved health
   outcomes associated with increases in vegetable consumption, these
   findings indicate the need for larger, longer-term evaluations of
   vegethon and similar technologies among overweight adults and other
   suitable target groups.}},

   purpose of the synergy study is to test the efficacy of a mobile health
   combined behavior intervention targeting physical activity and sleep
   quality.
   study design: randomized, waitlist-controlled trial.
   setting/participants: this study had an app-based delivery mode,
   australia-wide. the participants were 160 adults who reported
   insufficient physical activity and poor sleep quality in an eligibility
   survey.
   intervention: the intervention was a mobile app providing educational
   resources, goal setting, self-monitoring, and feedback strategies. it
   included 12 weeks of personalized support including weekly reports, tool
   sheets, and prompts.
   main outcome measures: outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3 months
   (primary), and 6 months (secondary endpoint). self-reported minutes of
   moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity and sleep quality were
   co-primary outcomes. resistance training; sitting time; sleep hygiene;
   sleep timing variability; insomnia severity; daytime sleepiness; quality
   of life; and depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms were secondary
   outcomes. data were collected between june 2017 and february 2018 and
   analyzed in august 2018.
   results: at 3 months, between-group differences in moderate-to-vigorous
   intensity physical activity were not statistically significant
   (p=0.139). significantly more participants in the intervention group
   engaged in >= 2 days/week (p=0.004) of resistance training. the
   intervention group reported better overall sleep quality (p=0.009),
   subjective sleep quality (p=0.017), sleep onset latency (p=0.013),
   waketime variability (p=0.018), sleep hygiene (p=0.027), insomnia
   severity (p=0.002), and lower stress symptoms (p=0.032) relative to
   waitlist controls. at 6 months, group differences were maintained for
   sleep hygiene (p=0.048), insomnia severity (p=0.002), and stress
   symptoms (p=0.006). differences were observed for bedtime variability
   (p=0.023), sleepiness (p<0.001), daytime dysfunction (p=0.039), and
   anxiety symptoms (p=0.003) at 6 months, but not 3 months.
   conclusions: this remotely delivered intervention did not produce
   statistically significant between-group differences in minutes of
   moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity. significant short-term
   differences in resistance training and short- and medium-term
   differences in sleep health in favor of the intervention were observed.

   sleep health in the adult population to decrease chronic disease rates
   and the associated burden. given the high prevalence of these risk
   behaviours, effective interventions with potential for wide reach are
   warranted.
   methods and analysis the aim of this two-arm rct will be to test the
   effect of a three month personalised mobile app intervention on two main
   outcomes: minutes of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity
   and overall sleep quality. in addition, between-group changes in
   health-related quality of life and mental health status will be assessed
   as secondary outcomes. the pre-specified mediators and moderators
   include social cognitive factors, the neighbourhood environment, health
   (bmi, depression, anxiety, stress), sociodemographic factors (age,
   gender, education) and app usage. assessments will be conducted after
   three months (primary endpoint) and six months (follow-up). the
   intervention will provide access to a specifically developed mobile app,
   through which participants can set goals for active minutes, daily step
   counts, resistance training, sleep times and sleep hygiene practice. the
   app also allows participants to log their behaviours daily and view
   progress bars as well as instant feedback in relation to goals. the
   personalised support system will consist of weekly summary reports,
   educational and instructional materials, prompts on disengagement and
   weekly facts.
   ethics and dissemination the human research ethics committee of the
   university of newcastle, australia granted full approval: h-2016-0181.
   this study will assess the efficacy of a combined behaviour
   intervention, mechanisms of behaviour change and gather high-quality
   process data, all of which will help refine future trials. dissemination
   of findings will include publication in a peer-reviewed journal and
   presentation at national or international conferences. participants will
   receive a plain english summary report of results.}},

   capture of narrative feedback by residents. the purpose of our study was
   to assess efficacy, usability, and acceptability of the f3app in family
   medicine residency programs.
   methods: residents, faculty, and program directors (pds) from eight
   residency programs participated in a beta test of the f3app from
   november 2017 to may 2018; participants completed pre- and
   postimplementation surveys about their evaluation process and the f3app.
   we interviewed pds, and analyzed responses using a thematic analysis
   approach.
   results: survey results showed significant postimplementation increases
   in faculty agreement that accessing evaluations is easy (42\%),
   evaluations are an effective way to communicate feedback (34\%),
   feedback is actionable and meaningful (24\%), and the current system
   provides meaningful data for promotion (33\%). among residents,
   agreement that the current system allows meaningful information sharing
   and is easy to use increased significantly, by 17\% each. the proportion
   of residents agreeing they were comfortable providing constructive
   criticism increased significantly (22\%). pds generally reported that
   residents were receptive to using the f3app, found it quick and easy to
   use, and that feedback provided was meaningful.
   conclusions: participating programs reviewed the f3app positively as a
   tool to gather narrative feedback from learners on faculty teaching.}},

  abstract          = {{phishing attacks have been increasing recently. attackers use clever
   social engineering techniques to convince their victims into clicking a
   malware or deceptive login-based webpages. most solutions for this
   particular problem focus more on helping desktop computer users than
   mobile device users. mobile device users are more vulnerable than their
   desktop counterparts because they are online most of the time and they
   have device limitations such as smaller screen size and low
   computational power. this paper presents unphishme, an effective mobile
   application prototype that takes advantage of a particular weakness of
   phishing sites: they accept any kind of input information for
   authentication. unphishme enables a mobile device user to create fake
   login account, with fake login credentials, that mimics user login
   procedure every time the user opens a login webpage and generates an
   alert to her. unphishme determines whether the current login page shifts
   to another webpage after an authentication attempt. it does so by
   monitoring hashcode changes of the url when the page is loading, listens
   to httpurlconnection status code, and then makes a decision on whether
   the website is fraudulent or not. we measured the effectiveness of
   unphishme by conducting a user experiment on android platforms and
   tested its detection accuracy, memory and cpu performance. the results
   show that unphishme uses a very small amount of computational power and
   it is effective in assisting users to identify phishing attacks with an
   accuracy of 96\%.}},

   mitigation efforts from academia and industry. we believe that users
   fall victim to attacks not only because of lack of knowledge and
   awareness, but also because they are not attentive enough to security
   indicators and visual abnormalities on the webpages they visit. this is
   also probably why smart device users, who have more limited screen size
   and device capabilities compared to desktop users, are three times more
   likely to fall victim to phishing attacks. to assert our claim, we first
   investigated general phishing awareness among different groups of
   smartphone users. we then used smart eyeglasses (electro-oculographic)
   to experimentally measure the mental effort and vigilance exhibited by
   users while surfing a website and while playing an android phishing game
   that we developed. the results showed that knowledge and awareness about
   phishing do not seem to have a significant impact on security
   behaviours, as knowledgeable participants exhibited insecure behaviours
   such as opening email attachments from unfamiliar senders. however,
   attentiveness was important as even participants with low cybersecurity
   knowledge could effectively identify attacks if they were reasonably
   attentive. based on these results, we asserted that users are more
   likely to continue falling victim to phishing attacks due to insecure
   behaviours, unless tools to lessen the identification burden are
   provided. we thus recommended implementing a lightweight algorithm into
   a custom android browser for detecting phishing sites deceptively
   without a user interaction. we used fake login credentials as validation
   agents and monitor the destination server http responses to determine
   the authenticity of a webpage. we also presented initial evaluation
   results of this algorithm.}},

   perception of verticality. altered verticality has been connected with
   disorders in the otolithic, visual or proprioceptive systems, caused by
   stroke, parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis, among others.
   currently, this test is carried out using a variety of specific, mostly
   homemade apparatuses that include moving planes, buckets, hemispheric
   domes or a line projected in a screen. our aim is to develop a flexible,
   inexpensive, user-friendly and easily extensible system based on virtual
   reality for the measurement of the svv and several related visual
   diagnostic tests, and validate it through an experimental evaluation.
   two different hardware configurations were tested with 50 healthy
   volunteers in a controlled environment; 28 of them were males and 22
   females, with ages ranging from 18 to 49 years, being 23 the average
   age. the intraclass correlation coefficient (icc) was computed in each
   device. in addition, a usability survey was conducted. icc = 0.85 in the
   first configuration (ci = 0.75-0.92), icc = 0.76 in the second
   configuration (ci = 0.61-0.87), both with 95\% of confidence, which
   means a substantial reliability. moreover, 92.2\% of subjects rated the
   usability of the system as ``very good{''}. our evaluation showed that
   the proposed system is suitable for the measurement of svv in healthy
   subjects. the next step is to perform a more elaborated experimentation
   on patients and compare the results with the measurements obtained from
   traditional methods.}},

  abstract             = {{background: gout is a form of chronic arthritis caused by elevated serum
   uric acid (sua) and culminates in painful gout attacks. although
   effective uric acid-lowering therapies exist, adherence is low. this is
   partly due to the lack of support for patients to self-manage their
   disease. mobile health apps have been used in the self-management of
   chronic conditions. however, not all are developed with patients,
   limiting their effectiveness.
   objective: the objective of our study was to collect feedback from gout
   patients to design an effective gout self-management app.
   methods: two descriptive qualitative studies were conducted. in study 1,
   researchers developed a short educational video and written materials
   about gout management, designed to be embedded into an app; 6 interviews
   and 1 focus group were held with gout patients to gather feedback on
   these materials. usability testing in study 2 involved additional gout
   patients using a pilot version of healthy. me gout, a gout
   self-management app, for 2 weeks. following the trial, patients
   participated in an interview about their experiences using the app.
   results: patients viewed the gout educational material positively,
   appreciating the combined use of video, text, and images. patients were
   receptive to using a mobile app to self-manage their gout. feedback
   about healthy. me gout was generally positive with patients reporting
   that the tracking and diary features were most useful. patients also
   provided suggestions for improving the app and educational materials.
   conclusions: these studies involved patients in the development of a
   gout self-management app. patients provided insight to improve the app's
   presentation and usability and general lessons on useful features for
   chronic disease apps. gout patients enjoyed tracking their sua
   concentrations and gout attack triggers. these capabilities can be
   translated into self-management apps for chronic diseases that require
   monitoring of pathological values, medication adherence, or symptoms.
   future health app design should integrate patient input and be developed
   iteratively to address concerns identified by patients.}},

   desirable reminder, educational, and behavioral modification features.
   usability testing was conducted with the subset of apps (n = 8) that had
   the greatest number of content features using a validated measure.
   results: apps contained an average of 4.21 of 15 content features, with
   medication reminder features being more common than either educational
   or behavioral modification features. apps most commonly included a
   medication name storage feature (95\%), a time-based reminder feature
   (87\%), and a medication dosage storage feature (68\%). of the eight
   apps that had the highest number of content features, mango health, myrx
   planner, and medisafe evidenced the highest usability ratings. no apps
   identified were specifically designed for pediatric use. discussion:
   most apps lacked content known to be useful in traditional pediatric
   adherence-promotion interventions. greater attention to educational and
   behavioral modification features may enhance the usefulness of
   medication reminder apps for pediatric groups. conclusion:

   framework. in this paper, okhttp is used to send network requests to the
   cloud server and the fall detection device is bound to the mobile client
   to obtain user and device information. after successfully obtaining
   data, the obtained information is displayed on the user interface
   through json parsing, including device positioning, electronic fence,
   fall alarm information and motion track. one login account can be bound
   to multiple devices. the login account is set to the emergency contact
   number of the elderly by default. when the elderly fall, fall guard can
   receive many types of fall alarm prompts, including alarm information
   list, notification bar reminder, sms notification, device user status
   bar information and other prompt functions. test results show that fall
   guard has good monitoring accuracy and terminal compatibility. on the
   one hand, it can adapt to different models and brands of android mobile
   terminals to achieve accurate positioning and alarm functions. on the
   other hand, due to its one-to-many management mode, it can be applied to

   need for accessible follow-along supports for individuals with serious
   mental illnesses in the workplace.
   objective: we explore the usability, usage, usefulness, and overall
   feasibility of the workingwell mobile app with individuals with serious
   mental illnesses who are actively employed and receiving community-based
   services.
   methods: in this proof-of-concept, mixed-methods, 2-month feasibility
   study (n=40), employed individuals with serious mental illnesses were
   recruited in mental health agencies. participants completed surveys
   regarding background characteristics and cellphone use at enrollment and
   responded to interview items regarding app usability, usage, and
   usefulness in technical assistance calls at 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks of
   participation and in the exit interview at 8 weeks. data on the
   frequency of app usage were downloaded on a daily basis. a version of
   the system usability scale (sus) was administered in the exit interview.
   overall feasibility was determined by the percent of users completing
   the study, responses to an interview item regarding continued use, and
   findings on usability, usage, and usefulness. general impressions were
   obtained from users regarding user support materials, technical
   assistance, and study procedures.
   results: most participants were male (60\%, 24/40), aged 55 or younger
   (70\%, 28/40), white (80\%, 32/40), had less than a 4-year college
   education (78\%, 31/40), were employed part-time (98\%, 39/40), had been
   working more than 6 months (60\%, 24/40), and indicated a diagnosis of
   bipolar, schizoaffective, or depressive disorder (84\%, 16/25). the
   majority of participants owned cellphones (95\%, 38/40) and used them
   multiple times per day (83\%, 33/40). their average rating on sus
   usability items was 3.93 (sd 0.77, range 1.57-5.00), reflecting positive
   responses. in general, participants indicated workingwell was ``very
   easy,{''} ``straightforward,{''} ``simple,{''} and ``user friendly.{''}
   usability challenges were related to personal issues (eg, memory) or to
   difficulties with the phone or app. data on app usage varied
   considerably. the most frequent navigations were to the home screen,
   followed by rate my day and my progress, and then by manage the moment
   and remind me. the app was described as useful by most participants;
   86\% (30/35) agreed the app would help them manage better on the job. of
   the 40 original participants, 35 (87\%) completed the study.
   conclusions: the workingwell app is a feasible approach to providing
   accessible, as-needed employment support for individuals with serious
   mental illnesses. the app would benefit from modifications to address
   recommendations from feasibility testing. controlled research with
   larger samples, more diverse in individual characteristics and workplace
   settings, is essential to demonstrating the effectiveness of the app.}},

  abstract       = {{real-time kinematic (rtk) technique is widely used in modern society
   because of its high accuracy and real-time positioning. the appearance
   of android p and the application of bcm47755 chipset make it possible to
   use single-frequency rtk and dual-frequency rtk on smartphones. the
   xiaomi mi 8 is the first dual-frequency global navigation satellite
   system (gnss) smartphone equipped with bcm47755 chipset. however, the
   performance of rtk in urban areas is much poorer compared with its
   performance under the open sky because the satellite signals can be
   blocked by the buildings and trees. rtk can't provide the positioning
   results in some specific areas such as the urban canyons and the
   crossings under an overpass. this paper combines rtk with an imu-based
   pedestrian navigation algorithm. we utilize attitude and heading
   reference system (ahrs) algorithm and zero velocity update (zupt)
   algorithm based on micro electro mechanical systems (mems) inertial
   measurement unit (imu) in smartphones to assist rtk for the sake of
   improving positioning performance in urban areas. some tests are carried
   out to verify the performance of rtk on the xiaomi mi 8 and we
   respectively assess the performances of rtk with and without the
   assistance of an imu-based pedestrian navigation algorithm in urban
   areas. results on actual tests show rtk with the assistance of an
   imu-based pedestrian navigation algorithm is more robust and adaptable
   to complex environments than that without it.}},

   is evaluated by purposefully introducing mis-alignment between the

   techniques to ensure the quality and reliability of software components.
   a recent literature review of software testing methodologies reveals
   that several new approaches, which differ in the way test inputs are
   generated to efficiently explore systems behaviour, have been proposed.
   this paper is concerned with the challenge of automatically generating
   test input sets for event-driven systems (eds) for which neither source
   code nor specifications are available, therefore we propose an
   innovative fully automatic testing with model learning technique. it
   basically involves active learning to automatically infer a behavioural
   model of the system under test (sut) using tests as queries, generates
   further tests based on the learned model to systematically explore
   unseen parts of the subject system, and makes use of passive learning to
   refine the current model hypothesis as soon as an inconsistency is found
   with the observed behaviour. our passive learning algorithm uses the
   basic steps of evidence-driven state merging (edsm) and introduces an
   effective heuristic for choosing the pair of states to merge to obtain
   the target machine. finally, the effectiveness of the proposed testing
   technique is demonstrated within the context of event-based functional
   testing of android graphical user interface (gui) applications and

   document images. while character recognition technology is mature, its
   application to mobile captured document image is still at its nascent
   stage. capturing images from a mobile camera poses several challenges
   like motion blur, defocus and geometrical distortions which are usually
   not encountered in scanned or calibrated camera captured images.
   therefore determining the quality of images automatically prior to
   recognition is an important problem. quality check is especially useful
   in financial transaction instruments like bill payment where accuracy of
   text recognition for sensitive fields such as ``amount due{''} should be
   high. poor quality images can be rejected prior to ocr to avoid
   incorrect text recognition and save processing time. this paper
   discusses some techniques in literature for blur detection in mobile
   camera captured document images. we propose a simple yet elegant method
   that addresses some challenges faced in these document images. extensive
   testing is performed on large dataset containing more than 4000 mobile
   captured images and optimum parameter values for performing quality
   check against motion blur and defocus are identified. our experimental

   the filter structure employs both a quaternion-based ekf and an adaptive
   extension, in which novel measurement methods are used to calculate the
   magnitudes of system vibrations, external accelerations, and magnetic
   distortions. these magnitudes, as external disturbances, are
   incorporated into a sophisticated fuzzy inference machine, which
   executes fuzzy if-then rules-based adaption laws to consistently modify
   the noise covariance matrices of the filter, thereby providing accurate
   and robust attitude results. a six-degrees of freedom (6 dof) test bench
   is designed for filter performance evaluation, which executes various
   dynamic behaviors and enables measurement of the true attitude angles
   (ground truth) along with the raw marg sensor data. the tuning of filter
   parameters is performed with numerical optimization based on the
   collected measurements from the test environment. a comprehensive
   analysis highlights that the proposed adaptive strategy significantly
   improves the attitude estimation quality. moreover, the filter structure
   successfully rejects the effects of both slow and fast external
   perturbations. the faekf can be applied to any mobile system in which
   attitude estimation is necessary for localization and external

   setting: minneapolis va health care system, minneapolis, minnesota.
   participants: veterans with spinal cord injury (n = 18).
   interventions: veterans with spinal cord injury engaged in iterative
   focus groups and personal interviews, sharing their needs and desires
   for the cmap app redesign. app developers used these data for the
   redesign. the redesigned cmap app was tested for six-weeks in users'
   homes.
   outcome measures: quantitative (surveys) and qualitative (interviews)
   methods measured feasibility for self-management of seating pressure.
   qualitative data were audio recorded, transcribed, anonymized, and
   coded. survey data were analyzed using summary statistics.
   results: after the cmap system's redesign, the in-home use interview
   found: (1) any tool that can assist in prevention and monitoring of skin
   ulcers is important; (2) the desired key features are present in the
   app; (3) the main barrier to cmap use was inconsistent functionality;

  abstract          = {{pop structures have been used widely in digital consumer electronics
   products such as digital still cameras and mobile phones. however, the
   final stack height from the top to the bottom package for these
   structures is higher than that of the current stacked die packages. to
   reduce the height of the package, a flip chip technology is used. since
   the logic chips of mobile applications use a pad pitch of less than 80
   mu m or less, an ultra-fine-pitch flip chip interconnection technique is
   required. c4 flip chip technology is widely used in area array flip chip
   packages, but it is not suitable in the ultrafine-pitch flip chips
   because the c4 solder bumps melt and collapse on the wide opening cu
   pads. although the industry uses ultrafine-pitch interconnections
   between au stud bumps on a chip and sn/ag pre-solder on a carrier, this
   flip chip technique has two major problems. one is that the need for
   bumps on both die and carrier drives up material costs. the other is
   that the long bonding process time required in the individual flip chip
   bonding process with associated heating and cooling steps demands large
   investments in equipment. to address these problems, we developed the
   mount and reflow with no-clean flux processes, and new interconnection
   techniques were developed with cu pillars and sn/ag solder bumps on al
   pads for wirebonding, were developed. it is very easy to control the gap
   between die and substrate by adjusting the cu pillar height. since it is
   unnecessary to control the collapse of the solder bumps, we call this
   the c2 process for direct chip connection (q). the c2 bumps are
   connected to cu substrate pads, which are a surface treated with osp
   (organic solder preservative), with reflow and no-clean processes. this
   technology creates the smt/flip chip hybrid assembly for sop (system on
   package) use. we have produced 50 mu m-pitch c2 interconnections and
   tested their reliability. the interconnection resistance increase caused
   by the reliability testing is quite small. it is clear that c2 flip chip
   technology provides robust solder connections at low cost. also the c2
   structure with a low-k device was evaluated and no failures were
   observed at 1,500 cycles in the thermal cycle test. this indicates that
   low-k c2 structures seem robust. for finer pitch flip chip
   interconnections, a wafer-level underfill process is needed to overcome
   the limitations of the standard capillary underfill process for
   ultra-narrow spaces. to date, a wafer- level underfill process exists
   for the c2 process with an 80-mu m pitch. in addition to fine pitch
   interconnections, a die thickness of 70 mu m is required to reduce the
   final stack height. such thin die cannot be processed by the c2 process
   because such dies slip too easily during the reflow process. to resolve
   this issue, a post-encapsulation grinding (peg) method was developed. in
   this method the die is ground to less than 70 mu m after joining and
   underfilling. this report presents the peg method and reliability test
   results for die thicknesses 20 mu m, 70 mu m and 150 mu m.}},

   distortions that degrade mri images during acquisition. blur is unique
   in comparison to rician noise and bias fields because it can be
   introduced into an image beyond the acquisition stage such as
   postacquisition processing and the manifestation of pathological
   conditions. most current blur assessment algorithms are designed and
   validated on consumer electronics such as television, video and mobile
   appliances. the few algorithms dedicated to medical images either
   requires a reference image or incorporate manual approach. for these
   reasons it is difficult to compare quality measures from different
   images and images with different contents. furthermore, they will not be
   suitable in environments where large volumes of images are processed. in
   this report we propose a new blind blur assessment method for different
   types of mri images and for different applications including automated
   environments.
   methods: two copies of the test image are generated. edge map is
   extracted by separately convolving each copy of the test image with two
   parallel difference of gaussian filters. at the start of the multiscale
   representation, the initial output of the filters are equal. in
   subsequent scales of the multiscale representation, each filter is tuned
   to different operating parameters over the same fixed range of gaussian
   scales. the filters are termed low and high energy filters based on
   their characteristics to successively attenuate and highlight edges over
   the range of multiscale representation. quality score is predicted from
   the distance between the normalized mean of the edge maps at the final
   output of the filters.
   results: the proposed method was evaluated on cardiac and brain mri
   images. performance evaluation shows that the quality index has very
   good correlation with human perception and will be suitable for
   application in routine clinical practice and clinical research.}},

   use of mobile devices, e.g., smartphones and tablets, improving energy
   efficiency in such devices, especially with communication driven
   workloads, is critical to providing a satisfactory user experience.
   studies show that signal strength plays an important role on energy
   consumption of cellular data communications. while energy consumption
   can be minimized by accurately predicting signal strengths and reacting
   to it in real-time, the dynamic nature of wireless environments makes
   signal strengths highly unpredictable. in this paper, after analyzing in
   detail the signal strength variation and its impact on energy
   consumption, we propose to use crowdsourcing approach to optimize mobile
   devices' energy efficiency by utilizing signal strength traces
   reported/shared by other users/devices in cellular networks. via a
   comprehensive measurement study, we observe that signal strength traces
   collected from different devices are pseudo-identical, and they even
   exhibit similar threshold-based behaviors in the relationship between
   signal strength and device power consumption. based on our observations,
   we propose a predictive scheduling algorithm that: (i) selects the right
   set of signal strength traces based on its location, (ii) applies a
   filter to smooth out signal strengths and hide abrupt changes, (iii)
   digitizes the signal strength to ``good{''} and ``bad{''} areas, and
   (iv) schedules transmissions based on power-throughput characteristics
   to optimize the transmission energy efficiency. to demonstrate the
   efficacy of the proposed algorithms, we prototype the
   crowdsourcing-based predicative scheduling algorithm on android-based
   smartphones. our experiment results from real-life driving tests
   demonstrate that, by leveraging others' signal traces, mobile devices
   can save energy up to 35 percent compared to the conventional
   opportunistic scheduling, i.e., schedule transmissions only based on
   instantaneous channel conditions.}},

   in using those features. methods: the usability test included four paid
   participants who are blind and four who have low vision. four different
   tasks using four different voip systems (two windows-based, two
   ios-based) were presented in random order. the online survey included
   participants with prior voip experience: 50 individuals who were blind
   and 22 who have low vision. results: usability test participants found
   that receiving an incoming call was the easiest task and transferring a
   call was the most difficult. those with previous ios experience had a
   large advantage with the two ios systems over those with little
   experience. for the online survey, most respondents (81\%) had used voip
   at home for personal use and 49\% had used it in their workplace. the
   caller id feature was most important to participants, yet only slightly
   more than half found the feature easy to use; this feature was the most
   discrepant between importance and ease of use (p < .01). call management
   was the most difficult feature for respondents. generally, those with
   low vision found features to be more accessible than did those who are
   blind. discussion: almost all usability study participants reported that
   they could use all four systems in a real-world setting. although some
   of the features were readily usable, many of the voip features that
   respondents to the online survey considered to be important were
   difficult for them to use. this finding indicates a serious gap between

   those with vision loss, indicating the necessity of adding accessible

   behavioral strategy that is leveraged in virtually every visit of
   behavioral weight loss interventions and is specifically used to deal
   with adherence and motivational issues is problem solving. problem
   solving has been successfully implemented in depression mobile apps, but
   not yet in weight loss apps.
   objective: this study describes the development and feasibility testing
   of the habit app, which was designed to automate problem-solving therapy
   for weight loss.
   methods: two iterative single-arm pilot studies were conducted to
   evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the habit app. in each
   pilot study, adults who were overweight or obese were enrolled in an
   8-week intervention that included the habit app plus support via a
   private facebook group. feasibility outcomes included retention, app
   usage, usability, and acceptability. changes in problem-solving skills
   and weight over 8 weeks are described, as well as app usage and weight
   change at 16 weeks.
   results: results from both pilots show acceptable use of the habit app
   over 8 weeks with on average two to three uses per week, the recommended
   rate of use. acceptability ratings were mixed such that 54\% (13/24) and
   73\% (11/15) of participants found the diet solutions helpful and 71\%
   (17/24) and 80\% (12/15) found setting reminders for habits helpful in

   and group discussion are key for effective qi, but convening in-person

   messaging platform, was implemented as a communication tool by a
   neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) team in an indian tertiary hospital
   seeking to reduce nosocomial infections in newborns.
   objective: this exploratory qualitative study aimed to examine
   experiences with whatsapp as a communication tool among improvement team
   members and an external coach to improve adherence to aseptic protocols.
   methods: ten qi team members and the external coach were interviewed on
   communication processes and approaches and thematically analyzed. the
   whatsapp transcript for the implementation period was also included in
   the analysis.
   results: whatsapp was effective for disseminating information, including
   guidance on qi and clinical practice, and data on performance
   indicators. it was not effective as a platform for group discussion to
   generate change ideas or analyze the performance indicator data. the
   decision of who to include in the whatsapp group and how members engaged
   in the group may have reinforced existing hierarchies. using whatsapp
   created a work environment in which members were accessible all the
   time, breaking down barriers between personal and professional time. the
   continual influx of messages was distracting to some respondents, and
   how respondents managed these messages (eg, using the silent function)
   may have influenced their perceptions of whatsapp. the coach used
   whatsapp to share information, schedule site visits, and prompt action
   on behalf of the team.
   conclusions: whatsapp is a productive communication tool that can be

  abstract          = {{outdoor shopping complexes (osc) are extremely difficult for people with
   visual impairment to navigate. existing gps devices are mostly designed
   for roadside navigation and seldom transition well into an osc-like
   setting. we report our study on the challenges faced by a blind person
   in navigating osc through developing a new mobile application named
   iexplore. we first report an exploratory study aiming at deriving
   specific design principles for building this system by learning the
   unique challenges of the problem. then we present a methodology that can
   be used to derive the necessary information for the development of
   iexplore, followed by experimental validation of the technology by a
   group of visually impaired users in a local outdoor shopping center.
   user feedback and other performance metrics collected from the
   experiments suggest that iexplore, while at its very initial phase, has
   the potential of filling a practical gap in existing assistive
   technologies for the visually impaired.}},

  abstract             = {{background: peripheral arterial disease (pad) is a common and severe
   disease with a highly increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
   through the circulatory disorder and the linked undersupply of oxygen
   carriers in the lower limbs, the ongoing decrease of the pain-free
   walking distance occurs with a significant reduction in patients'
   quality of life. studies including activity monitoring for patients with
   pad are rare and digital support to increase activity via mobile health
   technologies is mainly targeted at patients with cardiovascular disease
   in general. the special requirement of patients with pad is the need to
   reach a certain pain level to improve the pain-free walking distance.
   unfortunately, both poor adherence and availability of institutional
   resources are major problems in patient-centered care.
   objective: the objective of this trackpad pilot study is to evaluate the
   feasibility of a mobile phone-based self tracking app to promote
   physical activity and supervised exercise therapy (set) in particular.
   we also aim for a subsequent patient centered adjustment of the app
   prototype based on the results of the app evaluation and process
   evaluation.
   methods: this study was designed as a closed user group trial, with
   assessors blinded, and parallel group study with face-to-face components
   for assessment with a follow-up of 3 months. patients with symptomatic
   pad (fontaine stage iia or iib) and possession of a mobile phone were
   eligible. eligible participants were randomly assigned into study and
   control group, stratified by their distance covered in the 6-min walk
   test, using the software tenalea. participants randomized to the study
   group received usual care and the mobile intervention (trackpad) for the
   follow-up period of 3 months, whereas participants randomized to the
   control group received only usual care. trackpad records the frequency
   and duration of training sessions and pain level using manual user
   input. clinical outcome data were collected at the baseline and after 3
   months via validated tools (6-min walk test, ankle-brachial index, and
   duplex ultrasound at the lower arteries) and self-reported quality of
   life. usability and quality of the app was determined using the user
   version of the mobile application rating scale.
   results: the study enrolled 45 participants with symptomatic pad (44\%
   male). of these participants, 21 (47\%) were randomized to the study
   group and 24 (53\%) were randomized to the control group. the distance
   walked in the 6-min walk test was comparable in both groups at baseline
   (study group: mean 368.1m {[}sd 77.6] vs control group: mean 394.6m
   {[}sd 100.6]).
   conclusions: this is the first trial to test a mobile intervention
   called trackpad that was designed especially for patients with pad. its
   results will provide important insights in terms of feasibility,
   effectiveness, and patient preferences of an app-based mobile
   intervention supporting set for the conservative treatment of pad.}},

   adaptability of mobile apps is more with wide range use. the growth of
   mobile apps across various fields has shown a big challenge for mobile
   app development industries to deliver apps on time and budget with
   desired accuracy and performance. planning of mobile-based projects is a
   very complex task for the software industry, especially estimation of
   effort, time and cost for development of mobile apps. there are various
   literature, method, and model available in the field of classical
   software but mobile apps are different from classical software by their
   nature. it has also observed that the selection of input data is also
   affecting the accuracy of prediction. there is lack of calibrated model
   and method that administer the immense scope of determination in
   development of effort estimation for mobile apps. in this paper, various
   existing techniques of effort estimation have applied on software
   analytics for mobile apps (samoa) dataset for better analysis of

   results have presented that the ga was outperforming among four effort
   estimation techniques. mobile app effort estimation models have built
   using four-estimation technique using samoa dataset. in addition, we
   investigated and compared various techniques namely mlp, mlp-nn, ga and
   naive forecasting approach. upon construction, accuracy measures mmre,

  abstract             = {{technology plays an important role in our society, especially in the
   field of education. it is quite regrettable that people, particularly
   the deaf, still face a lot of challenges in acquiring an education.
   their learning methods are different as compared to hearing people. they
   use sign language (sl) rather than natural language to communicate and
   learn. they are required to put a lot of effort into learning different
   concepts using conventional pedagogies. therefore, there is a dire need
   for some assistive technology to improve their learn-ability and
   understandability. in the present study, 192 deaf participants aged 5-10
   years were sampled from two special child institutes. the objective of
   the present study was to determine the effectiveness of a mobile
   interface through a developed mobile application for learning basic
   mathematical concepts using pakistan sign language (psl). the present
   study bridges the gap between the technology-based method and
   conventional teaching methods, which are used for teaching mathematical
   concepts using psl. the participants were divided into two groups, that
   is, one group learned through conventional methods (flash cards and
   board) and the other group through the developed mobile application. the
   difference in the performance of both the groups was evaluated by
   conducting quizzes. the quiz results were analyzed by the z-test and
   anova. the findings revealed that the experimental group (eg)
   participants, who were instructed by our mobile application showed
   higher proficiency in the quizzes as compared to the control group (cg).
   eg participants performed better than cg by 12\% in the quizzes. a
   gender based difference was also observed for the quiz scores. male
   participants in category c (word problem learning) performed 2.7\%
   better than females in the eg and 2.5\% better in the cg. moreover, a
   significant difference was also observed in the time taken by
   participants in both groups to complete the quizzes. cg participants
   took 20 min longer than eg participants to complete the quizzes. the
   results of the anova showed that the quiz scores were directly affected
   by the mode of teaching used for participants in both groups.}},

   improving the effectiveness of monkey-based random testing in android,
   and how it compares with manual exploration. first, we show that random
   stress testing via monkey is extremely efficient (85 seconds on average)
   and effective at crashing apps, including 15 widely-used apps that have
   millions (or even billions) of installs. second, we vary monkey's event
   distribution to change app behavior and measured the resulting coverage.
   we found that, except for isolated cases, altering monkey's default
   event distribution is unlikely to lead to higher coverage. third, we
   manually explore 62 apps and compare the resulting coverages; we found
   that coverage achieved via manual exploration is just 2-3\% higher than
   that achieved via monkey exploration. finally, our analysis shows that
   coarse-grained coverage is highly indicative of fine-grained coverage,

   sources of experimental bias: spatial bias caused by distributions of
   training and testing data that are not representative of a real-world
   deployment; and temporal bias caused by incorrect time splits of
   training and testing sets, leading to impossible configurations. we
   propose a set of space and time constraints for experiment design that
   eliminates both sources of bias. we introduce a new metric that
   summarizes the expected robustness of a classifier in a real-world
   setting, and we present an algorithm to tune its performance. finally,
   we demonstrate how this allows us to evaluate mitigation strategies for
   time decay such as active learning. we have implemented our solutions in
   tesseract, an open source evaluation framework for comparing malware
   classifiers in a realistic setting. we used tesseract to evaluate three
   android malware classifiers from the literature on a dataset of 129k

   trellis-coded modulation (st-rtcm) systems with continuous-phase
   modulation (cpm) when the channel coefficients are known to the
   receiver. this algorithm is based on the cpm decomposed model, which
   exploits the memory properties of this modulation method, resulting in a
   straightforward implementation of joint st coding and cpm, which is
   particularly suitable for ring codes. this new scheme is used to
   investigate the performance of the delay diversity code with cpm over
   slow rayleigh fading channels, in particular with msk which is one of
   the most widely used modulation methods of continuous phase.
   furthermore, a feedback version of delay diversity allowed by the
   decomposition is tested in i rec and i rc systems. this feedback
   configuration is seen to provide good results for low signal-to-noise
   ratios. simulations results are also provided for multilevel st-rtcm
   codes that achieve a higher throughput than msk-coded systems.
   additionally the serial concatenation of an outer reed-solomon code with
   an st-rtcm code is shown, this combination further reduces the error

   subsequent need for a prostate biopsy. this has the potential to limit
   prostate cancer overdiagnosis and subsequent overtreatment. mhealth apps
   are gaining traction in urological practice and are used by both
   practitioners and patients for a variety of purposes.
   objective: the impetus of the study was to design, develop, and assess a
   smartphone app for prostate cancer screening, based on the rotterdam
   prostate cancer risk calculator (rpcrc).
   methods: the results of the rotterdam arm of the european randomized
   study of screening for prostate cancer (erspc) study were used to
   elaborate several algorithms that allowed the risk of prostate cancer to
   be estimated. a step-by-step workflow was established to ensure that
   depending on the available clinical information the most complete risk
   model of the rpcrc was used. the user interface was designed and then
   the app was developed as a native app for ios. the usability of the app
   was assessed using the post-study system usability questionnaire (pssuq)
   developed by ibm, in a group of 92 participants comprising urologists,
   general practitioners, and medical students.
   results: a total of 11 questions were built into the app, and, depending
   on the answers, one of the different algorithms of the rpcrc could be
   used to predict the risk of prostate cancer and of clinically
   significant prostate cancer (gleason score >= 7 and clinical stage
   >t2b). the system usefulness, information quality, and interface quality
   scores were high-92\% (27.7/30), 87\% (26.2/30), and 89\% (13.4/15),
   respectively. no usability problems were identified.
   conclusions: the rpcrc app is helpful in predicting the risk of prostate
   cancer and, even more importantly, clinically significant prostate
   cancer. its algorithms have been externally validated before and the
   usability score shows the app's interface is well designed. further
   usability testing is required in different populations to verify these
   results and ensure that it is easy to use, to warrant a broad appeal,
   and to provide better patient care.}},

  abstract      = {{age-friendly smartphone launchers are tools designed to enhance
   smartphone handling among older adults with cognitive and functional
   limitations. although evidence exists about the positive effects of
   age-friendly smartphone launchers on older adults' usability performance
   in general, little is known about how the design and interface
   complexity of these launchers affect their interface usability
   effectiveness and efficiency compared with standard android smartphone
   interfaces. thus, in this study, a randomized crossover experiment
   involving 50 older smartphone users, aged 60 years and above, was guided
   by the principles of summative usability testing to assess whether an
   age-friendly launcher performs better than a standard android launcher
   performs and to investigate the relationship between the user interface
   complexity and usability performance of launchers. the results of
   usability tests in which each participant solved 10 tasks on both
   launchers indicate that the two tested launchers had comparable
   effectiveness (i.e. completeness with which participants achieved the
   test tasks' goals), whereas the age-friendly launcher marginally
   outperformed its standard android counterpart in terms of efficiency
   (i.e. the amount of time used by participants to solve the test tasks).
   the results also demonstrate that lower user interface complexity is
   associated with higher effectiveness and efficiency, suggesting that
   age-friendly smartphone launchers might lead to higher adoption rates of
   smartphones among older adults if interface designers could reduce their
   cognitive complexity by limiting the number of steps and alternative
   paths for task completion.}},

  abstract             = {{the main objective of this work is to investigate on precise positioning
   with a gps and galileo enabled chipset embedded in a smartphone. the
   investigated area is real time precise positioning with single
   frequency, focusing on the benefits of multiconstellation gnss and raw
   data quality provided by a smartphone. the analysis is carried out with
   code-and carrier-based algorithms in different scenarios: simulated,
   stationary, pedestrian and vehicular.
   currently the smartphones use only one frequency (l1): this is an
   important constraint in the design of the precise positioning algorithm
   mainly due to ionospheric effect. hence, the work is based in two main
   algorithms: the first uses the carrier phase differential approach
   (static or kinematic) in conjunction of a reference gnss networks; the
   second is based on the variometric approach using the vadase algorithm,
   using the carrier phase but without external data.
   modern gnss chipsets are multi-constellations (gps, glonass, galileo,
   beidou) and the increased number of satellites that can be tracked
   allows to reduce the convergence time to fix and to estimate the user's
   position very precisely. in the proposed work, at least the gps+galileo
   combination is considered. the purpose is to evaluate the benefit of
   tracking different gnss constellations in terms of accuracy and
   convergence time. to develop software capable of this type of
   positioning, or perform these computations with existing software,
   pseudoranges and carrier-phase measurements are required. in principle,
   after the release of the n version of the android operating system, the
   raw data are obtainable from a phone or tablet. however, from a
   technical point of view, the raw data, especially the carrier-phase, are
   not directly available in standard format and must be properly parsed.
   moreover, on the basis of these parsed data, the paper analyses the main
   errors sources' of the gnss chipset embedded in smartphone. the primary
   error source on smartphones lies not in the gnss chipset, which actually
   offers great performance in terms of tracking availability and
   code-based accuracy, but in the antenna, whose chief failing is its poor
   multipath suppression. high accuracy positioning requires a stable
   antenna position for referring the position. however, moving smartphones
   are constantly changing attitude (which affects the antenna gain also),
   altitude (e.g. when the smartphone is kept in hand along the body or in
   front of the face for reading) and obstruction conditions. in order to
   quantify the impact of these scenarios, tests with internal and external
   antenna have been conducted. the use of multiconstellations' smartphone
   allows to increase the accuracy and the availability of the solution. in
   particular, the smartphone can reach decimetre accuracy in static
   condition and sub-metre when used in urban vehicle scenario;
   furthermore, the variometric approach is able to track the smartphone
   displacement with cm/sec velocity accuracy. the raw data provided are
   very good, especially for the pseudorange; the carrier phase can be
   affected by the internal clock, hence the smartphone should use an high
   quality tcxo (temperature compensated crystal oscillator).}},

   is highly dependent on self-management behaviors. mobile health
   (mhealth) apps could facilitate self-management and thus help improve
   population health. to achieve their potential, apps need to target
   specific behaviors with appropriate techniques that support change and
   do so in a way that allows users to understand and act upon the content
   with which they interact.
   objective: our objective was to identify apps targeted toward the
   self-management of chronic conditions and that are available in france.
   we aimed to examine what target behaviors and behavior change techniques
   (bcts) they include, their level of understandability and actionability,
   and the associations between these characteristics.
   methods: we extracted data from the google play store on apps labelled
   as top in the medicine category. we also extracted data on apps that
   were found through 12 popular terms (ie, keywords) for the four most
   common chronic condition groups-cardiovascular diseases, cancers,
   respiratory diseases, and diabetes-along with apps identified through a
   literature search. we selected and downloaded native android apps
   available in french for the self-management of any chronic condition in
   one of the four groups and extracted background characteristics (eg,
   stars and number of ratings), coded the presence of target behaviors and
   bcts using the bct taxonomy, and coded the understandability and
   actionability of apps using the patient education material assessment
   tool for audiovisual materials (pemat-a/v). we performed descriptive
   statistics and bivariate statistical tests.
   results: a total of 44 distinct native apps were available for download
   in france and in french: 39 (89\%) were found via the google play store
   and 5 (11\%) were found via literature search. a total of 19 (43\%) apps
   were for diabetes, 10 for cardiovascular diseases (23\%), 8 for more
   than one condition in the four groups (18\%), 6 for respiratory diseases
   (14\%), and 1 for cancer (2\%). the median number of target behaviors
   per app was 2 (range 0-7) and of bcts per app was 3 (range 0-12). the
   most common bct was self-monitoring of outcome(s) of behavior (31 apps),
   while the most common target behavior was tracking symptoms (30 apps).
   the median level of understandability was 42\% and of actionability was
   0\%. apps with more target behaviors and more bcts were also more
   understandable (rho=.31, p=.04 and rho=.35, p=.02, respectively), but
   were not significantly more actionable (rho=.24, p=.12 and rho=.29,
   p=.054, respectively).
   conclusions: these apps target few behaviors and include few bcts,
   limiting their potential for behavior change. while content is
   moderately understandable, clear instructions on when and how to act are
   uncommon. developers need to work closely with health professionals,
   users, and behavior change experts to improve content and format so apps
   can better support patients in coping with chronic conditions.
   developers may use these criteria for assessing content and format to
   guide app development and evaluation of app performance.}},

   self-assessment, contextual factors and facial feature analysis. this
   study also investigated the use of an ensemble algorithm for the
   classification of cognitive fatigue utilising facial features and a

   to directly correlate with reaction time through a psychomotor vigilance
   task (r = .643, p = .001), and self-reported increases in the level of
   social activity (r = .377, p = .001). facial feature analysis revealed
   dominant emotions of sadness and anger when participants were
   cognitively fatigued. it also revealed underlying facial cues that
   indicated higher levels of cognitive fatigue including expressions of
   negative valence, and facial action coding system units of increased
   brow furrow, eyelid tightening and lip suck. in addition, a principle
   component analysis based rotation forest ensemble with a ternary output
   demonstrated a cognitive fatigue classification accuracy of 82.17\%. the
   findings presented indicate that the inclusion of data relating to
   surrounding cognitive, social, physical and emotional factors can
   improve the accuracy of mobile in-situ cognitive fatigue assessment
   using our previously validated smartphone-based cognitive fatigue

   methods: we tested the infectieapp research app to detect aom symptom
   episodes. in 2013, we followed 155 children aged 0 to 3 years for 4
   months. parents recorded the presence of aom symptoms in a paper diary

   32.50\% (n=5606) and 43.99\% (n=3272) of diary days (p<.01). the
   incidence of aom symptom episodes was 605 and 835 per 1000 child-years,
   respectively. disease questionnaires were completed for 59\% (17/29) of
   episodes when participants were using conventional recording, compared
   with 100\% (18/18) for app-based recording.
   conclusions: the use of the study's smart diary app improved aom case
   finding and disease questionnaire completeness. for common infectious
   diseases that often remain undetected by health care services, use of
   this technology can substantially improve the accurateness of disease
   burden estimates.}},

  abstract  = {{background: a digital medicine system (dms) has been developed to
   measure and report adherence to an atypical antipsychotic, aripiprazole,
   in psychiatric patients. the dms consists of 3 components: ingestible
   sensor embedded in a medication tablet, wearable sensor, and secure
   mobile and cloud-based applications. an umbrella study protocol was
   designed to rapidly assess the technical performance and safety of the
   dms in multiple substudies to guide the technology development.
   methods: two sequential substudies enrolled 30 and 29 healthy volunteers
   between march-april 2014 and february-march 2015, respectively, to
   assess detection accuracy of the ingestible sensor by the dms and the
   latency period between ingestion and detection of the ingestion by the
   wearable sensor or the cloud-based server.
   results: the first substudy identified areas for improvement using early
   versions of the wearable sensor and the mobile application. the second
   substudy tested updated versions of the components and showed an overall
   ingestion detection rate of 96.6\%. mean latency times for the signal
   transmission were 1.1-1.3 minutes (from ingestion to the wearable sensor
   detection) and 6.2-10.3 minutes (from the wearable sensor detection to
   the server detection). half of transmissions were completed in < 2
   minutes, and similar to 90\% of ingestions were registered by the
   smartphone within 30 minutes of ingestion. no serious adverse events,
   discontinuations, or clinically significant laboratory/vital signs
   findings were reported.
   conclusions: the dms implementing modified versions of the smartphone
   application and the wearable sensor has the technical capability to
   detect and report tablet ingestion with high accuracy and acceptable
   latency time. (c) copyright 2016 physicians postgraduate press, inc.}},

  abstract             = {{background: the introduction of home therapy for hemophilia has
   empowered patients and their families to manage the disease more
   independently. however, self-management of hemophilia is demanding and
   complex. the uses of innovative interventions delivered by telehealth
   routes such as social media and web-based and mobile apps, may help
   monitor bleeding events and promote the appropriate use of clotting
   factors among patients with hemophilia.
   objective: this scoping review aims to summarize the literature
   evaluating the effectiveness of telehealth interventions for improving
   health outcomes in patients with hemophilia and provides direction for
   future research.
   methods: a search was conducted in ovid medline, embase, and pubmed
   databases for studies that (1) focused on patients with hemophilia a or
   b; (2) tested the use of remote telehealth interventions via the
   internet, wireless, satellite, telephone, and mobile phone media on
   patients and caregivers; and (3) reported on at least one of the
   following patient-/caregiver-focused outcomes related to empowering
   patients/caregivers to be active decision makers in the emotional,
   social, and medical management of the illness: quality of life,
   monitoring of bleeding episodes, joint damage or other measures of
   functional status, medication adherence, and patients' knowledge.
   implementation outcomes (user metrics, cost saving, and accuracy of
   electronic records) were also evaluated. reviews, commentaries, and case
   reports comprising <= 10 cases were excluded.
   results: sixteen articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. the majority
   of the interventions (10/16, 62\%) evaluated both implementation
   outcomes and patient-/caregiver-focused outcomes. user performance and
   accuracy and comprehensiveness of electronic records were also measured
   in most studies (4/16, 87\%). the components of the interventions were
   rather homogenous and typically involved electronic logging and
   reminders for prophylactic infusions, reporting of spontaneous and
   traumatic bleeding events, monitoring of infusion product usage and home
   inventory, and real-time communication with health care professionals
   and hemophilia clinics. telemedicine-supported education and information
   interventions seemed to be particularly effective among adolescent and
   young adult patients. although the patients reported improvements in
   their health-related quality of life and perception of illness,
   telemonitoring devices did not appear to have a significant effect on
   quantifiable health outcomes such as joint health. longitudinal studies
   seemed to suggest that the response and adherence rates to recording
   decreased over time.
   conclusions: preliminary evidence from this review suggests that
   telehealth-delivered interventions could feasibly improve patients'
   adherence to medication use and promote independence in disease
   management. given the complexity and resources involved in developing a
   mature and established system, support from a dedicated network of
   hemophilia specialists and data managers will be required to maintain
   the technology, improve adherence to prophylactic treatment and
   recording, and validate the electronic data locally.}},

   carriers, as an innovative approach for direct surface mount technology
   (smt) attach of large silicon, glass, and low coefficient of thermal
   expansion organic interposers to printed wiring boards (pwbs). the
   microwire arrays (mwas) are prefabricated as free-standing ultrathin
   carriers using standard, low-cost manufacturing processes such as laser
   vias and copper electroplating. such wire array carriers are then
   assembled in between the interposer and the pwb as a stress-relief
   interlayer. the mwa interconnections show low interconnection stress and
   strains even without the underfills. the approach is extensible to
   larger interposer sizes (20 mm x 20 mm) and finer pitch (400 mu m),
   making it suitable for smart mobile systems. the parallel wire arrays
   that form each joint result in low resistance and inductance, and
   therefore, do not degrade the electrical performance. the scalability of
   these structures allows extendibility to finer pitch and larger
   interposer sizes for high-performance applications. the finite-element
   method was used to design the mwas to meet the thermomechanical
   reliability requirements. computational models were built in 2.5-d
   geometries to study the reliability of 400-mu m-pitch interconnections
   with a 100-mu m-thick, 20 mm x 20 mm silicon interposer that was
   smt-assembled onto an organic pwb. the warpage, equivalent plastic
   strain, and projected fatigue life of the mwa interconnections are
   compared with those of the ball grid array interconnections. a unique
   set of materials and processes was used to demonstrate the low-cost
   fabrication of the mwas. copper microwires with 15 mu m diameter and 50
   mu m height were fabricated on both sides of a 50-mu m-thick
   thermoplastic polymer carrier using dry-film-based photolithography and
   bottom-up electrolytic plating. the copper microwire interconnections
   were assembled between silicon interposer and fr-4 pwb with
   smt-compatible processes. thermomechanical reliability of the
   interconnections was characterized by thermal cycling test from -40
   degrees c to 125 degrees c. the initial fatigue failure in the
   interconnections was identified at 700 cycles, consistent with the
   models.}},

  abstract          = {{convolutional neural networks (cnns) have been widely investigated as
   some of the most promising solution for various computer vision tasks.
   however, cnns introduce massive computing overhead due to their complex
   network computing flow, resulting in significantly reduced applicability
   and performance, especially in the mobile devices. various optimization
   schemes have been proposed mainly based on both model compression and
   stacked external computing resources. while these schemes have been
   proven effective, methods which take into account mobile-specific
   context-aware optimization approaches have been largely overlooked. one
   such opportunity is the feasible cnn computing flow simplification to
   the under-test objects with distinguish features, which can be
   efficiently pre-analyzed inside the mobile sensor system. hence, we
   propose vocam, a visualization oriented cnn acceleration framework on
   mobile devices for image classification tasks. vocam takes advantage of
   the mobile camera system, where the comprehensive pre-analysis can be
   conducted to reveal the color composition of the under-test images
   without incurring any additional overhead. also, the visualization
   analysis of vocam reveals that, certain color-specific filters may have
   very trivial result impact when the under-test images have mismatching
   primary color components. then a set of approximate computing methods is
   applied to these insignificant filters to replace the intensive
   convolutional operation, and greatly accelerate the computing process.
   with ignorable overhead, vocam can significantly optimize the
   computation load of the convolutional layers, with very small impact on
   the overall classification accuracy.}},

   ischemic attack (tia) score, and the subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah) rule
   have all previously demonstrated the potential to significantly
   standardize care and improve the management of patients in emergency
   departments (eds). on the basis of user feedback, we believe that the
   addition of these rules to the ottawa rules app has the potential to
   increase the app's usability and user acceptability.
   objective: this study aimed to evaluate the perceived usefulness,
   acceptability, and uptake of the enhanced ottawa rules app (which now
   includes cchr, tia, and sah rules) among ed clinicians (medical
   students, residents, nurses, and physicians).
   methods: the enhanced ottawa rules app was publicly released for free on
   ios and android operating systems in november 2018. this study was
   conducted across 2 tertiary eds in ottawa, canada. posters, direct
   enrollment, snowball sampling, and emails were used for study
   recruitment. a 24-question web-based survey was administered to
   participants via email, and this was used to determine user
   acceptability of the app and technology readiness index (tri) scores.
   in-app user analytics were collected to track user behavior, such as the
   number of app sessions, length of app sessions, frequency of rule use,
   and the date app was first opened.
   results: a total of 77 ed clinicians completed the study, including 34
   nurses, 12 residents, 14 physicians, and 17 medical students completing
   ed rotations. the median tri score for this group was 3.38, indicating a
   higher than average propensity to embrace and adopt new technologies to
   accomplish goals in their work or daily lives. the majority of
   respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the app helped participants
   accurately carry out the clinical rules (56/77, 73\%) and that they
   would recommend this app to their colleagues (64/77, 83\%). feedback
   from study participants suggested further expansion of the app-more
   clinical decision rules (cdrs) and different versions of the app
   tailored to the clinician role. analysis and comparison of google
   analytics data and in-app data revealed similar usage behavior among
   study-enrolled users and all app users globally.
   conclusions: this study provides evidence that using the ottawa rules
   app (version 3.0.2) to improve and guide patient care would be feasible
   and widely accepted. the ability to verify self-reported user data (via
   a web-based survey) against server analytics data is a notable strength
   of this study. participants' continued app use and request for the
   addition of more cdrs warrant the further development of this app and
   call for additional studies to evaluate its feasibility and usability in
   different settings as well as assessment of clinical impact.}},

   numbers, and vulnerable certificate verification, seriously threaten
   software security. the vision of automatically screening cryptographic
   api calls in massive-sized (e.g., millions of loc) programs is not new.
   however, hindered by the practical difficulty of reducing false
   positives without compromising analysis quality, this goal has not been
   accomplished. cryptoguard is a set of detection algorithms that refine
   program slices by identifying language-specific irrelevant elements. the
   refinements reduce false alerts by 76\% to 80\% in our experiments.
   running our tool, cryptoguard, on 46 high-impact large-scale apache
   projects and 6,181 android apps generated many security insights. our
   findings helped multiple popular apache projects to harden their code,
   including spark, ranger, and ofbiz. we also have made progress towards
   the science of analysis in this space, including manually analyzing
   1,295 apache alerts, confirming 1,277 true positives (98.61\%

   genetic conditions such as down syndrome are complex and should be well
   informed. moreover, the number of available tests is increasing. shared
   decision making (sdm) about testing could be facilitated by decision
   aids powered by mobile technology.
   objective: in this mixed methods study, we aim to (1) assess women's
   needs and preferences regarding using an app for considering prenatal
   screening, (2) develop a decision model using the analytical hierarchy
   process, and (3) develop an analytical app and assess its usability and
   usefulness.
   methods: in phase 1, we will assess the needs of 90 pregnant women and
   their partners (if available). we will identify eligible participants in
   3 clinical sites (a midwife-led birthing center, a family practice
   clinic, and an obstetrician-led hospital based clinic) in quebec city
   and montreal, canada. using semistructured interviews, we will assess
   participants' attitudes toward mobile apps for decision making about
   health, their current use of apps for health purposes, and their
   expectations of an app for prenatal testing decisions. self-administered
   questionnaires will collect sociodemographic information, intentions to
   use an app for prenatal testing, and perceived importance of decision
   criteria. qualitative data will be transcribed verbatim and analyzed
   thematically. quantitative data will be analyzed using descriptive
   statistics and the analytic hierarchy process (ahp) method. in phase 2,
   we will develop a decision model using the ahp whereby users can assign
   relative importance to criteria when deciding between options. we will
   validate the model with potential users and a multidisciplinary team of
   patients, family physicians, primary care researchers, decision sciences
   experts, engineers, and experts in sdm, genetics, and bioethics. in
   phase 3, we will develop a prototype of the app using the results of the
   first 2 phases, pilot test its usefulness and usability among a sample
   of 15 pregnant women and their partners (if available), and improve it
   through 3 iterations. data will be collected with a self-administered
   questionnaire results will be analyzed using descriptive statistics.
   results: recruitment for phase 1 will begin in 2019. we expect results
   to be available in 2021.
   conclusions: this study will result in a validated analytical app that
   will provide pregnant women and their partners with up-to-date
   information about prenatal screening options and their risks and
   benefits. it will help them clarify their values and enable them to
   weigh the options to make informed choices consistent with their
   preferences and values before meeting face-to-face with their health
   care professional. the app will be easy to update with the latest
   information and will provide women with a user-friendly experience using
   their smartphones or tablets. this study and the resulting app will
   contribute to high-quality sdm between pregnant women and their health

  abstract             = {{background: distorted perception of one's body and appearance, in
   general, is a core feature of several psychiatric disorders including
   anorexia nervosa and body dysmorphic disorder and is operative to
   varying degrees in nonclinical populations. yet, body image perception
   is challenging to assess, given its subjective nature and variety of
   manifestations. the currently available methods have several limitations
   including restricted ability to assess perceptions of specific body
   areas. to address these limitations, we created somatomap, a mobile tool
   that enables individuals to visually represent their perception of
   body-part sizes and shapes as well as areas of body concerns and record
   the emotional valence of concerns.
   objective: this study aimed to develop and pilot test the feasibility of
   a novel mobile tool for assessing 2d and 3d body image perception.
   methods: we developed a mobile 2d tool consisting of a manikin figure on
   which participants outline areas of body concern and indicate the
   nature, intensity, and emotional valence of the concern. we also
   developed a mobile 3d tool consisting of an avatar on which participants
   select individual body parts and use sliders to manipulate their size
   and shape. the tool was pilot tested on 103 women: 65 professional
   fashion models, a group disproportionately exposed to their own visual
   appearance, and 38 nonmodels from the general population. acceptability
   was assessed via a usability rating scale. to identify areas of body
   concern in 2d, topographical body maps were created by combining
   assessments across individuals. statistical body maps of group
   differences in body concern were subsequently calculated using the
   formula for proportional z-score. to identify areas of body concern in
   3d, participants' subjective estimates from the 3d avatar were compared
   to corresponding measurements of their actual body parts. discrepancy
   scores were calculated based on the difference between the perceived and
   actual body parts and evaluated using multivariate analysis of
   covariance.
   results: statistical body maps revealed different areas of body concern
   between models (more frequently about thighs and buttocks) and nonmodels
   (more frequently about abdomen/waist). models were more accurate at
   estimating their overall body size, whereas nonmodels tended to
   underestimate the size of individual body parts, showing greater
   discrepancy scores for bust, biceps, waist, hips, and calves but not
   shoulders and thighs. models and nonmodels reported high ease-of-use
   scores (8.4/10 and 8.5/10, respectively), and the resulting 3d avatar
   closely resembled their actual body (72.7\% and 75.2\%, respectively).
   conclusions: these pilot results suggest that somatomap is feasible to
   use and offers new opportunities for assessment of body image perception
   in mobile settings. although further testing is needed to determine the
   applicability of this approach to other populations, somatomap provides
   unique insight into how humans perceive and represent the visual
   characteristics of their body.}},

   individuals at risk for knee injury by measuring genu valgus during
   sport related tasks. the reliability of 2d mobile motion analysis in
   measuring genu valgus during a single leg hop test on individuals with
   anterior knee pain has not been examined.
   purpose: to assess the reliability and concurrent validity of 2d mobile
   motion analysis and compare it to visual observation while analyzing
   dynamic genu valgus during a single leg hop test in subjects with
   anterior knee pain.
   study design: cohort study; repeated measures
   methods: nineteen subjects experiencing anterior knee pain completed a
   single leg hop test with both lower extremities. two investigators
   independently estimated the degrees of genu valgus with visual
   observation alone during the subjects' single leg hop. after the visual
   estimation, the investigators watched the video again using the 2d spark
   motion pro (tm)(m) application to pause the video and measured the
   amount of knee valgus with a virtual goniometer tool on the application.
   interrater reliability was calculated using intraclass correlation
   coefficients (icc) model 2, k and intrarater rater reliability using
   model 3, k. minimal detectable change, concurrent validity and limits of
   agreement were calculated.
   results: visual observation alone demonstrated interrater reliability
   iccs of 0.682-0.685 on the symptomatic and non-symptomatic lower
   extremities respectively. the interrater reliability using the 2d
   application had icc's of 0.927 and 0.792 on the symptomatic and
   non-symptomatic lower extremities respectively. the concurrent validity
   for 2d analysis and visual observation on the symptomatic lower
   extremity had icc values of 0.96 (rater a) and 0.85 (rater b). the
   non-symptomatic lower extremity demonstrated concurrent validity icc
   values of 0.95(rater a) and 0.65(rater b). the standard error of
   measurement(sem) was 3.89 degrees and 3.25 degrees for the symptomatic
   and non-symptomatic lower extremity(le) respectively for visual
   observation. when using the spark motion pro(tm) application the sem was
   1.64 degrees and 2.71 degrees for the symptomatic and non-symptomatic le
   respectively. the minimal detectable change (mdc) using visual
   observation alone was 5.5 degrees and 4.6 degrees. when using the
   application, it was noted at 2.32 degrees and 3.83 degrees on the
   symptomatic and non-symptomatic le respectively.
   conclusion: the results of this study support the use of a 2d mobile
   application as a reliable tool for measuring knee valgus in symptomatic
   subjects and offers reduced error (sem =1.64 degrees) when compared to
   visual observation alone (sem = 3.89 degrees).}},

   participants: subjects with (n = 25) and without shoulder pain (n = 29).
   main outcome measures: subjects were assessed by the same examiner in
   two sessions, with one-week interval. active joint repositioning tests
   of shoulder flexion and scaption and elbow flexion were assessed at the
   target-angles of 50 degrees, 70 degrees, 90 degrees and 110 degrees.

  abstract       = {{purpose: extensive pre-clinical and clinical experimentation has yielded
   data on the robustness and versatility of epidural stimulation (es)
   strategies to activate spinal neural circuitry to produce functional
   benefits. increasing studies are now reporting that closed-loop
   electrical stimulation delivery methods significantly enhance the
   neuromodulation effects of stimulation, to in turn, improve
   physiological outcomes of the intervention. no studies have yet explored
   the feasibility and usage of closed-loop systems to neuromodulate the
   cervical spinal cord using es.
   methods: we developed an activity-dependent system that utilizes
   electromyography (emg) activity to trigger epidural stimulation (tes) of
   the cervical spinal cord in awake, freely moving rats. experiments were
   performed on rats that were implanted with chronic forelimb emg and
   cervical epidural implants, with (n = 7) and without (n = 2) a complete
   c4 spinal hemisection.
   results: our results show that the emg triggered activity-dependent
   system can be reliably applied and reproduced for: (i) stimulating
   multiple rats simultaneously throughout the night during free home-cage
   activity and (ii) use as a mobile system for testing and training during
   various short-term behavioral testing conditions. the system was able to
   consistently generate stimulation pulse trains in response to attempted
   emg activity that crossed a user-defined threshold in all rats for all
   experiments, including the overnight experiments that lasts for 7
   h/session for 6 days/week through the 3-month period.
   conclusion: the developed closed-loop system can be considered to
   represent a class of bidirectional neural prostheses via a circuit that
   enables two-way interactions between neural activity (real-time
   processing of emg activity) and external devices (such as a stimulator).
   it can operate autonomously for extended periods of time in unrestrained
   rats, allowing its use as a long-term therapeutic tool. it can also
   enable us to study the long-term physiological effects of incorporating
   electrical stimulation techniques into the nervous system. the system
   can also be experimented for connecting several neural systems into a
   brainet by combining neural signals from multiple rats dynamically and
   in real-time so as to enhance motor performance. studies are ongoing in
   our laboratory to test the usefulness of this system in the recovery of
   hand function after cervical spinal cord injuries.}},

   and landslides are one of the many hazards that devastates the country.
   the country's population and average amount of rainfall increases
   annually, causing the risk of landslides to increase as well. because of
   this, there is a need to develop new techniques and models to measure
   landslide susceptibility to help mitigate the problem. although there
   are already existing techniques available, most of these are very costly
   and requires the presence of an expert. since the philippines have very
   limited financial capabilities, maximizing the use of available

   right approach to mitigate the effects of natural hazards such as
   landslides. to address this concern, the grouped developed an
   application for landslide susceptibility assessment and site mapping

   features as instant messages, phone calls, video calls, and voicemails.
   basic voip protocols were designed to be efficient instead of secure.
   after numerous attacks on these protocols several solutions were

   the security of session initiation protocol (sip) that is used to
   initiate, modify, and terminate the voip sessions. the paper presents
   the design and implementation of secure layered architecture for sip,
   which adds a new layer to the standard sip layer model and entitled as
   security layer. the security layer provides authentication,
   authorization, adaptable feature, and secure key exchange, based on our
   newly designed protocol, named as session initiation protocol using
   single sign-on (sipsso). in order to implement the secure layered
   architecture based on sipsso, we have developed an android securecall
   application and extend the open source asterisk accordingly. after the
   designing and implementation phases, we have verified the sipsso
   protocol formally by using an automated security verification tool,
   scyther. our analysis results reveal that by adding security layer, we
   ensured protection against different sip attacks such as eavesdropping,

   communications engineering. the convergence of fixed-line and mobile
   telephony with the internet together with the rise of novel technologies
   for rapid service creation has made economic efficiency and user
   acceptance/usability to crucial factors for the success of the
   telecommunication business as such. in the emerging new paradigm, a
   holistic view onto the entire value chain from basic architectural
   concepts over the efficient design and implementation of new services
   and applications up to the end customer is becoming indispensable.
   within this broad interdisciplinary field, the present paper focuses on
   the evolution of corresponding concepts for service quality. whereas the
   traditional notion of `qos' (quality-of-service) is already
   well-established and has led to a plethora of research work mainly in
   the area of network architectures and protocols, the quality of service
   design ('qod') has by far not received comparable attention in the
   research community. nevertheless, we argue that both concepts are
   equally important for achieving a sufficient quality of user experience
   ('qoe') which eventually leads to both economic viability and user
   satisfaction. to illustrate our claim, we discuss recent developments in
   the area of qos-enabled next generation network architectures as well as
   novel user-centric service design paradigms, examples for the resulting
   qoe evaluations and a novel hci lab approach which allows flexible user
   tests of mobile applications ``in the wild{''}.}},

  abstract             = {{mobile organic rankine cycle (morc) systems represent a candidate
   technology for the reduction of fuel consumption and co2 emissions from
   heavy-duty vehicles. through the recovery of internal combustion engine
   waste heat, energy can be either compounded or used to power vehicle
   ancillary systems. waste heat recovery systems have been shown to
   deliver fuel economy improvements of up to 13\% in large diesel engines
   {[}i].
   whilst the majority of studies focus on individual component performance
   under specific thermodynamic conditions, there has been little
   investigation into the effects of expander specification across
   transient test cycles used for heavy-duty engine emission certification.
   it is this holistic approach which will allow prediction of the validity
   of morc systems for different classes of heavy-duty vehicle, in addition
   to providing an indication of system performance.
   this paper first describes a meanline (one-dimensional simulation along
   a mean streamline within a flow passage) model for radial orc turbines,
   divided into two main subroutines. an on-design code takes a
   thermodynamic input, before generating a candidate geometry for a chosen
   operating point. the efficacy of this design is then evaluated by an off
   design code, which applies loss correlations to the proposed geometry to
   give a prediction of turbine performance.
   the meanline code is then executed inside a quasi-steady-state orc cycle
   model, using reference emission test cycles to generate exhaust (heat
   source) boundary conditions, generated by a simulated 11.7l heavy-duty
   diesel engine. a detailed evaporator model, developed using the
   ntu-effectiveness method and single/two-phase flow correlations,
   provides accurate treatment of heat flow within the system. together,
   these elements allow estimation of orc system performance across entire
   reference emission test cycles.
   in order to investigate the limits of morc performance, a genetic
   algorithm is applied to the orc expander; aiming to optimize the
   geometry specification (radii, areas, blade heights, angles) to provide
   maximal time-averaged power output. this process is applied across the
   reference duty cycles, with the implications on power output and turbine
   geometry discussed for each.
   due to the large possible variation in thermodynamic conditions within
   the turbine operating range a typical ideal gas methodology (generating
   a single operating map for interpolation across all operating points) is
   no longer accurate - a complete off-design calculation must therefore be
   performed for all operating points. to reduce computational effort,
   discretization of the orc thermodynamic inputs (temperature, mass flow
   rate) is investigated with several strategies proposed for reduced-order
   simulation.
   the paper concludes by predicting which heavy-duty emission test cycles
   stand to benefit the most from this optimization procedure, along with a
   comparison to existing transient results. duty cycles containing narrow
   bands of operation were found to provide optimal performance, with a
   constant-speed, variable-load cycle achieving an average power output of
   4.60 kw. consideration is also given to the effectiveness of the
   methodology contained within the paper, the challenges of making orc
   systems viable for mobile applications, along with suggestions for
   future research developments.}},

   salesforce, their customers and information technology (it) staff to
   work together in developing requirements and prototypes for mobile b2b
   context-aware applications.
   research limitations/implications - the cabs model would require
   empirical testing to assess its viability and suitability. this would
   initially be done via focus groups in targeted sales organizations.
   practical implications - the cabs model could utilized by sales staff
   and their customers to develop requirements for mobile context-aware
   applications to support b2b activity. in addition, the cabs model could
   be utilized in joint application design processes to enable sales and it
   staff to work together in developing prototype mobile applications.
   originality/value - while context-aware applications are beginning to
   transform business-to-sale (b2c) sales activities, it is clear that b2b
   sales could also benefit from these types of applications, but little
   progress has been made in understanding or developing their potential.
   the cabs model enables b2b sales staff and their customers to recognize
   these benefits and facilitate working with it staff in defining
   requirements and developing prototypes.}},

   in this study, we assessed the reliability of the apn service.
   methods: custom software was written to send a message every minute to
   ios devices (ipad((r)), ipod touch((r)), and iphone((r))) via wireless
   local area network (wlan) and cellular pathways 24 hours a day over a
   4-month period. transmission and receipt times were recorded and batched
   by days, with latencies calculated as their differences. the mean, sem,
   and the exact 95\% upper confidence limits for the percent of days with
   1 prolonged (>100 seconds) latency were calculated. acceptable
   performance was defined as mean latency <30 seconds and 0.5\% of
   latencies >100 seconds. testing conditions included fixed locations of
   devices in high signal strength locations.
   results: mean latencies were <1 second for ipad and ipod devices (wlan),
   and <4 seconds for iphone (cellular). among >173,000 ipad and ipod
   latencies, none were >100 seconds. for iphone latencies, 0.03\% 0.01\%
   were >100 seconds. the 95\% upper confidence limits of days with 1
   prolonged latency were 42\% (iphone) and 5\% to 8\% (ipad, ipod).
   conclusions: the apn service was reliable for all studied devices over
   wlan and cellular pathways, and performance was better than third party
   paging systems using internet connections previously investigated using
   the same criteria. however, since our study was a best-case assessment,
   testing is required at individual sites considering use of this
   technology for critical messaging. furthermore, since the apn service
   may fail due to internet or service provider disruptions, a backup
   paging system is recommended if the apn service were to be used for

   recent years and has become an important part of the software
   development market. indeed, mobile apps become more and more complex and
   evolve constantly, while their development time decreases. this
   complexity and time pressure might lead developers to adopt bad design
   and implementation choices, which are known as code smells. code smells
   in mobile apps could lead to performance issues such as overconsumption
   of hardware resources (cpu, ram, battery) or even downtime and crashes.
   some tools have been proposed for the detection of code smells in
   android apps, such as paprika or adoctor tools. these tools rely on
   metrics-based detection rules, which are defined manually according to
   code smell definitions. however, manually defined rules might be
   inaccurate and subjective because they are based on user
   interpretations. in this paper, we present a tool-based approach, called
   fakie, which allows the automatic inference of detection rules by
   analysing code smells data using an association rules algorithm:
   fp-growth. we validated fakie by applying it on a manually analysed
   validation dataset of 48 opensource mobile apps. we were able to
   generate detection rules for a dozen code smells, with an average
   f-measure of 0.95. after all of that, we performed an empirical study by
   applying fakie on 2,993 apps downloaded from androzoo, a repository of

   methods: twenty materials comprising 10 flowers and 10 rhizomes were
   extracted with 70\% ethanol. their activity was then examined at a
   concentration of 10\% (w/v) against streptococcus mutans in vitro on
   mueller-hinton media. erythromycin (oxoid, 20 mg disc) was used as a
   positive control. meanwhile, to establish a fingerprint guide for
   authentication or quality control, the most potent material was further
   analyzed regarding its chemical constituents by means of reversed
   phase-high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) and thin-layer
   chromatography (tlc).
   results: of the tested samples, sesbania grandiflora (s. grandiflora)
   flower and costus speciosus rhizome extracts showed the most potent
   activity with inhibited zone diameters of 18.5 and 14.8 mm,
   respectively. on the other hand, other extract plants showed a diameter
   zone in the range of 0.5-10.6 mm or being inactive (diameter = 0 mm).
   the activity of s. grandiflora was comparable to that of erythromycin
   (diameter = 18.0 mm). the best separation was achieved on hplc system
   with acetonitrile-water with a ratio of 2: 8, and a flow rate at 0.5

  abstract             = {{purpose - this research aims to focus on providing interventions to
   alleviate usability challenges to strengthen the overall accuracy and
   the navigation effectiveness in indoor and stringent environments
   through the experiential manipulation of technical attributes of the
   positioning and navigation system.
   design/methodology/approach - the study followed a quantitative and
   experimental method of empirical enquiry and software engineering and
   synthesis research methods. the study further entails three
   implementation processes, namely, map generation, positioning framework
   and navigation service using a prototype mobile navigation application
   that uses the near field communication (nfc) technology.
   findings - the approach and findings revealed that the capability of nfc
   in leveraging its low-cost infrastructure of passive tags, its
   availability in mobile devices and the ubiquity of the mobile device
   provided a cost-effective solution with impressive accuracy and
   usability. the positioning accuracy achieved was less than 9 cm. the
   usability improved from 44 to 96 per cent based on feedbacks given by
   respondents who tested the application in an indoor environment. these
   showed that nfc is a viable alternative to resolve the challenges
   identified in previous solutions and technologies.
   research limitations/implications - the major limitation of the
   navigation application was that there is no real-time update of user
   position. this can be investigated and extended further by using nfc in
   a hybrid make-up with wlan, radio-frequency identification (rfid) or
   bluetooth as a cost-effective solution for real-time indoor positioning
   because of their coverage and existing infrastructures. the hybrid
   positioning model, which merges two or more techniques or technologies,
   is becoming more popular and will improve its accuracy, robustness and
   usability. in addition, it will balance complexity, compensate for the
   limitations in the technologies and achieve real-time mobile indoor
   navigation. although the presence of wlan, rfid and bluetooth
   technologies are likely to result in system complexity and high cost,
   nfc will reduce the system's complexity and balance the trade-off.
   practical implications - whilst limitations in existing indoor
   navigation technologies meant putting up with poor signal and poor
   communication capabilities, outcomes of the nfc framework will offer
   valuable insight. it presents new possibilities on how to overcome
   signal quality limitations at improved turn-around time in constrained
   indoor spaces.
   social implications - the innovations have a direct positive social
   impact in that it will offer new solutions to mobile communications in
   the previously impossible terrains such as underground platforms and
   densely covered spaces. with the ability to operate mobile applications
   without signal inhibitions, the quality of communication - and
   ultimately, life opportunities - are enhanced.
   originality/value - while navigating, users face several challenges,
   such as infrastructure complexity, high-cost solution, inaccuracy and
   usability. hence, as a contribution, this paper presents a symbolic map
   and path architecture of a floor of the test-bed building that was
   uploaded to openstreetmap. furthermore, the implementation of the rfid
   and the nfc architectures produced new insight on how to redress the
   limitations in challenged spaces. in addition, a prototype mobile indoor
   navigation application was developed and implemented, offering novel
   solution to the practical problems inhibiting navigation in indoor
   challenged spaces - a practical contribution to the community of
   practice.}},

   assessing functional capacity in patients with cardiopulmonary
   conditions. it is usually performed in the context of a hospital clinic
   and thus requires the involvement of hospital staff and facilities, with
   their associated costs.
   objective: this study aimed to develop a mobile phone-based system that
   allows patients to perform the 6mwt in the community.
   methods: we developed 2 algorithms to compute the distance walked during
   a 6mwt using sensors embedded in a mobile phone. one algorithm makes use
   of the global positioning system to track the location of the phone when
   outdoors and hence computes the distance travelled. the other algorithm
   is meant to be used indoors and exploits the inertial sensors built into
   the phone to detect u-turns when patients walk back and forth along a
   corridor of fixed length. we included these algorithms in a mobile phone
   app, integrated with wireless pulse oximeters and a back-end server. we
   performed bland-altman analysis of the difference between the distances
   estimated by the phone and by a reference trundle wheel on 49 indoor
   tests and 30 outdoor tests, with 11 different mobile phones (both apple
   ios and google android operating systems). we also assessed usability
   aspects related to the app in a discussion group with patients and
   clinicians using a technology acceptance model to guide discussion.
   results: the mean difference between the mobile phone-estimated
   distances and the reference values was -2.013 m (sd 7.84 m) for the
   indoor algorithm and -0.80 m (sd 18.56 m) for the outdoor algorithm. the
   absolute maximum difference was, in both cases, below the clinically
   significant threshold. a total of 2 pulmonary hypertension patients, 1
   cardiologist, 2 physiologists, and 1 nurse took part in the discussion
   group, where issues arising from the use of the 6mwt in hospital were
   identified. the app was demonstrated to be usable, and the 2 patients
   were keen to use it in the long term.
   conclusions: the system described in this paper allows patients to
   perform the 6mwt at a place of their convenience. in addition, the use
   of pulse oximetry allows more information to be generated about the
   patient's health status and, possibly, be more relevant to the real-life
   impact of their condition. preliminary assessment has shown that the
   developed 6mwt app is highly accurate and well accepted by its users.
   further tests are needed to assess its clinical value.}},

  abstract             = {{background: user mobility is an important aspect of the development of
   clinical information systems for health care professionals. mobile
   phones and tablet computers have obtained widespread use by health care
   professionals, offering an opportunity for supporting the access to
   patient information through specialized applications (apps) while
   supporting the mobility of the users. the use of apps for mobile phones
   and tablet computers may support workflow of complex tasks, for example,
   molecular-based diagnostic tests in clinical microbiology. multiplex
   blood culture test (muxbct) is a molecular-based diagnostic test used
   for rapid identification of pathogens in positive blood cultures. to
   facilitate the workflow of the muxbct, a specialized tablet computer app
   was developed as an accessory to the diagnostic test. the app aims to
   reduce the complexity of the test by step-by-step guidance of microscopy
   and to assist users in reaching an exact bacterial or fungal diagnosis
   based on blood specimen observations and controls. additionally, the app
   allows for entry of test results, and communication thereof to the
   laboratory information system (lis).
   objective: the objective of the study was to describe the design
   considerations of the muxbct app and the results of a preliminary
   usability evaluation.
   methods: the muxbct tablet app was developed and set up for use in a
   clinical microbiology laboratory. a near-live simulation study was
   conducted in the clinical microbiology laboratory to evaluate the
   usability of the muxbct app. the study was designed to achieve a high
   degree of realism as participants carried out a scenario representing
   the context of use for the muxbct app. as the muxbct was under
   development, the scenario involved the use of molecular blood culture
   tests similar to the muxbct for identification of microorganisms from
   positive blood culture samples. the study participants were observed,
   and their interactions with the app were recorded. after the study, the
   participants were debriefed to clarify observations.
   results: four medical laboratory technicians, for example,
   representative of end users of the app, participated in the clinical
   simulation study. using the muxbct app, the study participants
   successfully identified and reported all microorganisms from the
   positive blood cultures examined. three of the four participants
   reported that they found the app useful, while one study participant
   reported that she would prefer to make notes on paper and later enter
   them into the lis.
   conclusions: the preliminary usability evaluation results indicate that
   use of the muxbct tablet app can facilitate the workflow of the muxbct
   diagnostic test.}},

   to validate the pim 3 score have been limited.
   objective to evaluate the pim 3 score for predicting the probability of
   death in the picu, dr. mohammad hoesin hospital (mhh), palembang.
   methods a prospective, cohort study was performed in the picu, mhh,
   palembang, from february to april 2016. the pim 3 score was calculated
   within 2 hours of patients admission to the picu by an android
   calculator application. pim3 score and mortality were analyzed by
   mann-whitney test; calibration was performed by hosmer-lameshow goodness
   of fit test, discrimination was done by receiver operating
   characteristic (roc) curve analysis; and standardized mortality ratio
   (smr) was calculated.
   results during the study period there were 81 picu patients, 69 children
   were included, ranging in age from 1,5 to 187 months. the overall
   mortality rate was 40,58\%. the most common illnesses in our subjects
   were malignancy (17,4\%), post non-thoracic surgery (14,5\%), dengue

   conclusion in mohammad hoesin hospital, palembang, south sumatera, the
   pim 3 can be used to predict mortality in picu patients, but the score
   should be multiplied by a factor of 2.24. this recalibration is needed

   synchronizer) is proposed as a means for making high-speed connections
   with very low power consumption, both among multiple chips such as
   processors, controllers, and storage devices, and among on-chip modules.
   the synchronizer not only provides a wide range of operating
   frequencies, but is fast locking and only occupies a small area on chip.
   therefore, it contributes to large reductions in power consumption and
   costs. it is suitable for use in various low-power systems (e.g.,
   battery-hungry mobile appliances and low-cost consumer electronic
   products). three major techniques were applied to the design: 1) a
   multi-grain structure for the delay elements, which greatly reduces the
   number of gates while facilitating locking in a very small number of
   clock cycles; 2) constant-ratio-coupled (crc) delay lines (measurement
   versus generation) for flexible selection of the input-output delay; and
   3) a new lock stage decision circuit (lsdc) scheme, conferring excellent
   testability. moreover, the architecture is all-digital, and thus it has
   high process portability. by applying these techniques to a ddr memory
   interface circuit for a mobile application processor fabricated in
   130-nm technology, we were able to reduce power consumption by 42\% and
   chip area by 65\% compared with a conventional implementation.
   furthermore, the novel design spans a frequency range covering 12 times

   factors that are hard to control for, we investigate how pedestrian
   navigation methods can be evaluated in virtual reality (vr). we present
   a study comparing navigation methods in real life (rl) and vr to
   evaluate if vr environments are a viable alternative to rl environments
   when it comes to testing these. in a series of studies, participants
   navigated a real and a virtual environment using a paper map and a
   navigation app on a smartphone. we measured the differences in
   navigation performance, task load and spatial knowledge acquisition
   between rl and vr. from these we formulate guidelines for the
   improvement of pedestrian navigation systems in vr like improved
   legibility for small screen devices. we furthermore discuss appropriate
   low-cost and low-space vr-locomotion techniques and discuss more
   controllable locomotion techniques.}},

   of a specially customized weight table. the ilm enables parallel data
   processing and it is well suited to a wide variety of applications and
   promises unprecedented performance gains in dynamic environments. here
   we show how linear and non-linear regression and classification modeling
   methods are transformed into intelligent methods. this method has now
   been successfully software implemented and tested using a variety of
   databases. hardware implementation of the ilm is feasible and we foresee
   an ilm chip for faster computations and mobile applications. subsequent
   papers will show how the elm can be applied to methods such as bayesian

  abstract       = {{background: the insertion of fixed orthodontic appliances increases the
   risk of dental caries, particularly in adolescents. caries can be
   prevented through good oral health behavior. to support adolescents with
   fixed orthodontic appliances and for promoting oral health behavior, we
   developed a theory- and evidence-based mhealth program, the whiteteeth
   app.
   objective: the objective of our paper was to describe the systematic
   development and content of the whiteteeth app.
   methods: for systematic development of the program, we used the
   intervention mapping (im) approach. in this paper, we present the
   results of applying the first 5 steps of im to the design of an mhealth
   program: (1) identifying target behaviors and determinants through
   problem analysis, including a literature search, a survey study, and
   semistructured interviews, to explore adolescent oral health behavior
   during orthodontic therapy; (2) defining program outcomes and
   objectives; (3) selecting theoretical methods and translating them into
   practical strategies for the program design; (4) producing the program,
   including a pilot test with 28 adolescents testing the acceptability and
   usability of the whiteteeth app; and (5) planning implementation and
   adoption.
   results: on the basis of our literature search, we identified fluoride
   use and control of dental plaque levels (eg, tooth brushing and proxy
   brush usage) as target behaviors for preventing caries. next, we
   identified important and changeable determinants of oral health behavior
   that fitted the theoretical concepts of the health action process
   approach (hapa) theory. the hapa theory, the self-regulation theory, and
   the results of the semistructured interviews were used to define the
   program objectives, that is, the performance and change objectives.
   after defining the objectives, we identified multiple behavior change
   techniques that could be used to achieve these objectives, such as
   providing oral health information and feedback, prompting
   self-monitoring, coaching of set actions and coping plans, and sending
   reminders. we translated these methods into practical strategies, such
   as videos and a brushing timer. next, we combined these strategies into
   a single program resulting in the whiteteeth app (which is available on
   both itunes and google play stores as ``witgebit{''}). adolescents with
   fixed orthodontic appliances and dental professionals were included in
   the development process to increase the success of implementation. the
   pilot test revealed that the app users appreciated and liked the app.
   the whiteteeth app can be integrated into current orthodontic care.
   conclusions: im allowed us to identify multiple techniques that have
   been shown to be the most effective in initiating behavior change, but
   have not yet been incorporated into existing orthodontic apps. the
   whiteteeth app contains all these techniques, which makes it a unique
   and promising home-based app for promoting oral health in adolescents
   with fixed orthodontic appliances.}},

   (prisma) statement. english publications were included if: 1) mobile
   applications were used in the context of large-scale collection of data
   for biomedical research, and not as medical or behavioral intervention
   of any kind, and 2) all activities related to participating in research
   and data collection methods were executed remotely without any
   face-to-face interaction between researchers and study participants.
   results: thirty-six unique researchkit apps were identified. the
   majority of the apps were used to conduct observational studies on
   general citizens and generate large datasets for secondary research.
   nearly half of the apps were focused on chronic conditions in adults.
   discussion: the ability to generate large biomedical datasets on diverse
   populations that can be broadly shared and re-used was identified as a
   promising feature of mhealth research apps. common challenges were low
   participation retention, uncertainty regarding how use patterns
   influence data quality, need for data validation, and privacy concerns.
   conclusion: researchkit and other mhealth-based studies are well
   positioned to enhance development and validation of novel digital
   biomarkers as well as generate new biomedical knowledge through
   retrospective studies. however, in order to capitalize on these
   benefits, mhealth research studies must strive to improve retention

   a foundation for the current study, we conducted formative research
   using focus groups, participatory design sessions, and usability
   evaluation methods to inform the development of a health management app
   for plwh. the formative research resulted in identification of the
   following functional requirements of a mhealth app for self-management:
   (1) communication between providers and peers, (2) medication reminders,
   (3) medication log, (4) lab reports, (5) pharmacy information, (6)
   nutrition and fitness, (7) resources (eg, social services, substance

   objective: the purpose of this study was to conduct an ecological review
   of the existing apps for plwh and to compare the functionality of
   existing apps with the app specifications identified in our formative
   work.
   methods: we searched two mobile app stores (google play and itunes) and
   found a total of 5606 apps. we reviewed the apps, narrowed our search
   terms, and found a total of 112 apps. of these, we excluded 97 (86.6\%)
   apps that were either not in english (10/112, 8.9\%), not hiv focused
   (32/112, 28.9\%), or focused only on hiv prevention (2/112, 7.8\%);
   targeted health care providers (26/112, 23.2\%); provided information
   only on conference schedules and events (7/112, 6.3\%), fundraisers
   (7/112, 6.3\%), specific clinics (7/112, 6.3\%), international or narrow
   local resources (3/112, 2.7\%); or were identified in the first search
   but were no longer on the market at the next review (4/112, 3.6\%). the
   15 apps meeting inclusion criteria were then evaluated for inclusion of
   the nine functionalities identified in our earlier work.
   results: of the 15 apps that we included in our final review, none had
   all of the functionalities that were identified in our formative work.
   the apps that we identified included the following functionalities:
   communication with providers and/or peers (4/15, 27\%), medication

   included nutrition or fitness information.
   conclusions: currently, there are only a small number of apps that have
   been designed for plwh to manage their health. of the apps that are
   currently available, none have all of the desired functionalities

   and to assess how they meet their information needs.
   methods: we gave 60 adolescents smartphones with unlimited text
   messaging and data for 30 days. each smartphone had applications related
   to asthma, obesity, human immunodeficiency virus, and diet preinstalled
   on the phone. we sent text messages 3 times per week and asked the
   following questions: (1) what questions did you have about your health
   today? (2) where did you look for an answer (mobile device, mobile
   application, online, friend, book, or parent)? (3) was your question
   answered and how? (4) anything else?

   collection procedures, despite numerous associated drawbacks. the
   questionsys framework is intended to empower researchers as well as
   clinicians without programming skills to develop their own smart mobile
   apps in order to collect data for their specific scenarios.
   objective: in order to validate the feasibility of this model-driven,
   end-user programming approach, we conducted a study with 80
   participants.
   methods: across 2 sessions (7 days between session 1 and session 2),
   participants had to model 10 data collection instruments (5 at each
   session) with the developed configurator component of the framework. in
   this context, performance measures like the time and operations needed
   as well as the resulting errors were evaluated. participants were
   separated into two groups (ie, novices vs experts) based on prior
   knowledge in process modeling, which is one fundamental pillar of the
   questionsys framework.
   results: statistical analysis (t tests) revealed that novices showed
   significant learning effects for errors (p=.04), operations (p<.001),
   and time (p<.001) from the first to the last use of the configurator.
   experts showed significant learning effects for operations (p=. 001) and
   time (p<.001), but not for errors as the experts' errors were already
   very low at the first modeling of the data collection instrument.
   moreover, regarding the time and operations needed, novices got
   significantly better at the third modeling task than experts were at the
   first one (t tests; p<.001 for time and p=. 002 for operations).
   regarding errors, novices did not get significantly better at working
   with any of the 10 data collection instruments than experts were at the
   first modeling task, but novices' error rates for all 5 data collection
   instruments at session 2 were not significantly different anymore from
   those of experts at the first modeling task. after 7 days of not using
   the configurator (from session 1 to session 2), the experts' learning
   effect at the end of session 1 remained stable at the beginning of
   session 2, but the novices' learning effect at the end of session 1
   showed a significant decay at the beginning of session 2 regarding time
   and operations (t tests; p<.001 for time and p=.03 for operations).
   conclusions: in conclusion, novices were able to use the configurator
   properly and showed fast (but unstable) learning effects, resulting in
   their performances becoming as good as those of experts (which were
   already good) after having little experience with the configurator.
   following this, researchers and clinicians can use the questionsys
   configurator to develop data collection apps for smart mobile devices on
   their own.}},

   applications to track data dependencies in hardware and machine-,

   success in practice: being a vulnerability analysis, false positives
   must be low for the analysis to be practical. this paper presents an
   approach to taint tracking, which does not involve tracking taints
   throughout computation. instead, we include shadow memories in the
   execution context, so that a single run of a program has the effect of
   computing on both tainted and untainted data. this mechanism is inspired
   by the technique of secure multi-execution, while in contrast to the
   latter it does not require running the entire program multiple times. we
   present a general framework and establish its soundness with respect to
   explicit secrecy, a policy for preventing insecure data leaks, and its
   precision showing that runs of secure programs are never modified. we
   show that the technique can be used for attack detection with no false
   positives. to evaluate the mechanism in practice, we implement
   droidface, a source-to-source transform for an intermediate java-like
   language and benchmark its precision and performance with respect to
   representative static and dynamic taint trackers for android. the

   furthermore, new mobile malware is emerging daily that introduces new
   security risks. however, while existing security solutions generally
   protect mobile devices against known risks, they are vulnerable to as

   malicious software is generally difficult to predict. therefore,
   anti-malware software is in continuous development in order to be able
   to detect new malware or new variants of existing malware. similarly, as
   long as anti-malware software develops, malware writers also develop
   their malicious code by using various evasion strategies, such as
   obfuscation and encryption. this is the lifecycle of malicious and
   anti-malware software. in this paper, the use of evolutionary
   computation techniques are investigated, both for developing new
   variants of mobile malware which successfully evades anti-malware
   systems based on static analysis and for developing better security
   solutions against them automatically. a coevolutionary arms race

  abstract             = {{biometric systems are vulnerable to different kinds of attacks.
   particularly, the systems based on iris are vulnerable to direct attacks
   consisting on the presentation of a fake iris to the sensor trying to
   access the system as it was from a legitimate user. the analysis of some
   countermeasures against this type of attacking scheme is the problem
   addressed in the present paper. several state-of-the-art methods were
   implemented and included in a feature selection framework so as to
   determine the best cardinality and the best subset that conducts to the
   highest classification rate. three different classifiers were used:
   discriminant analysis, k nearest neighbours and support vector machines.
   the implemented methods were tested in existing databases for iris
   liveness purposes (biosec and clarkson) and in a new fake database which
   was constructed for evaluation of iris liveness detection methods in the
   mobile scenario. the results suggest that this new database is more
   challenging than the others. therefore, improvements are required in
   this line of research to achieve good performance in real world mobile
   applications.}},

   participants in the control group (cg), 18 in the group with mild ad and
   22 in the group with moderate ad. they performed two mobility tests,
   under st and dt conditions, which were registered using an android

   developing mobile information and communication technologies for
   healthcare. adolescents are known for their ubiquitous use of mobile
   technologies in everyday life. however, the use of mhealth tools among

   objective: we examined the usability of four commonly used mobile
   devices (an iphone, an android with touchscreen keyboard, an android
   with built-in keyboard, and an ipad) for accessing healthcare
   information among a group of urban-dwelling adolescents. methods: guided
   by the fitt (fit between individuals, task, and technology) framework, a
   think-aloud protocol was combined with a questionnaire to describe
   usability on three dimensions: 1) task-technology fit; 2)
   individual-technology fit; and 3) individual-task fit.
   results: for task-technology fit, we compared the efficiency, and
   effectiveness of each of the devices tested and found that the iphone
   was the most usable had the fewest errors and prompts and had the lowest
   mean overall task time for individual-task fit, we compared efficiency
   and learnability measures by website tasks and found no statistically
   significant effect on tasks steps, task time and number of errors.
   following our comparison of success rates by website tasks, we compared
   the difference between two mobile applications which were used for diet
   tracking and found statistically significant effect on tasks steps, task
   time and number of errors. for individual-technology fit, interface
   quality was significantly different across devices indicating that this
   is an important factor to be considered in developing future mobile
   devices.
   conclusions: all of our users were able to complete all of the tasks,
   however the time needed to complete the tasks was significantly
   different by mobile device and mhealth application. future design of
   mobile technology and mhealth applications should place particular

   interviews with medical and service providers of h/uh youth. usability
   and feasibility testing were done with target audiences. additionally,
   we conducted focus groups with youth regarding the app's youth

   have carefully chosen three quality tools that cover testing of all

   growing rapidly, especially by the massive implementations of artificial

   implementation for handwriting digit recognition. a client-server is set
   based on tensorflow with multiple models for classifications. the client
   is set based on a mobile application that the user inputs the digit by
   touch panel of the mobile. in this paper, the models at the server are
   trained and tested by using mnist database of handwritten. in addition,
   we use convolutional neural network (cnn) to improve the performance of
   the neural network. the client-server allows many users to he accessed
   by ai model from the same time. the advantage of using client-server
   approach is reducing power and time for processing handwriting
   recognition in client device. it also speeds up the time of development
   and implementation of algorithm on the server.}},

   extensively used in mobile phones today. however, it is vulnerable to
   potential security attacks such as shoulder surfing, camera attack and
   smudge attack. this study proposes a new kind of authentication system
   based on a generative deep neural network that can defend any attacks by
   imposters except a registered user. this network adopts the anomaly
   detection paradigm where only normal data is used while training the
   network. for this purpose, we utilize both generative adversarial
   networks as an anomaly detector and long short term memory that
   processes id time varying signals converted from 2d android patterns. to
   handle the stability problem of gans during the training, replay buffer,
   which has been effectively used in deep q-networks, is also utilized.
   evaluation of the proposed method was carried out thoroughly and the
   accuracy reached to 0.95 in term of the area under curve. although
   training this network requires extensive computing resources, it runs on
   a mobile phone well since the testing version is very light. further
   experiments conducted using a group of mobile phone users, including
   posture variation study, provided comparable performance as well.
   results suggest that the proposed system has a potential for real world

   methods: this is a cross sectional study that evaluated community health
   worker driven hearing screening that took place in semi-rural malindi,
   kenya during an annual two-week otolaryngology surgical training mission
   in october 2017. at five separate locations (four schools) near malindi,
   kenya, children between the ages of 2-16 underwent hearing screening
   using screening audiometry (android-based hearx group). children were
   screened by a community health worker who underwent a short training
   course, a senior otolaryngology resident, or both. hearing screening
   results were compared to determine the reliability and concordance
   between independent, blinded community health worker and otolaryngology
   resident testing.
   results: one hundred and four participants (53\% males) underwent
   hearing screening. hearing screening pass rate was 93\%. community
   health workers obtained a similar result to otolaryngology residents
   96\% of the time (mcnemar test: p = 0.16, or 0.96, 95\% ci 0.9-1.0).
   conclusion: community health workers can obtain reliable results using a
   technology-based, pre-surgical hearing screening platform when compared
   to otolaryngology residents. this finding has profound implications in
   low-resourced settings where hearing healthcare specialists
   (audiologists and otolaryngologists) are limited and can ultimately

   attacks that can compromise the security of voice authentication
   technology deployed in several popular, state-of-the-art android and ios
   apps. our study is based on our formulated sneakers attack system that
   comprises a variety of well-known as well as newly designed attacks: (1)
   recorded and replayed voice of the authorized user (replay attack); (2)
   reordered and played-back voice of the authorized user (reorder attack);
   and (3) synthesized voice generated - based on voice conversion
   techniques - using an unauthorized user's voice (standard conversion
   attack), or using a noise-free recording from a text-to-speech engine
   (tts conversion attack). taking sneakers as a basis, we report on a
   carefully designed study to examine a variety of real-world voice
   authentication apps for their vulnerability against malicious
   authentication.
   our study follows a two-phase methodology. in the preliminary phase, we
   analyze 8 popular mobile apps against standard simplistic attack setups.
   our results show that, while the tested apps seem to resist the reorder
   attack and the standard conversion attack, they are highly vulnerable to
   the replay attack. in the main phase of the study, we comprehensively
   assess 5 of the above apps against more advanced newly designed attack
   setups. like in the preliminary phase, the apps prove to be highly
   vulnerable to the replay attack. more seriously, the apps also turn out
   to be highly insecure against our advanced attack setups, i.e., the
   reorder attack with coordinated timing and the tts conversion attack,
   yielding success rates of 82\%-98\%. these malicious authentication
   measurement results are highly pertinent in practice because, we
   demonstrate that the apps generally work well in the benign
   authentication scenario to reliably ``accept{''} an authorized user and
   ``reject{''} an unauthorized user.
   our work shows that many standard attacks that prior work demonstrated
   to be effective against standalone voice authentication algorithms do
   not work against current voice authentication apps. yet, our new attack
   designs could still compromise these apps. overall, our work highlights
   a serious vulnerability of real-world voice authentication apps, which
   seems very challenging to mitigate at a fundamental level.}},

   systematically cataloged and assessed mobile apps designed to assist
   medication compliance and nutrition tracking that are useful to the
   chronic kidney disease (ckd) and the end-stage renal disease (esrd)
   patients who are on dialysis.
   objective: the objective of this study was to comprehensively evaluate
   mobile apps used for medication compliance and nutrition tracking for
   possible use by ckd and esrd patients.
   methods: a systematic review framework was applied to the search,
   screening, and assessment of apps identified and downloaded from the ios
   and android app stores. we selected apps using 13 relevant search terms,
   narrowed down based on a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria, and
   then used the mobile app rating scale (mars), a widely adopted app
   evaluation tool to assess the effectiveness of apps. the internal
   consistency and interrater reliability were tested using cronbach alpha
   and interclass correlation coefficients (iccs), respectively.
   results: the mars total score had excellent internal consistency
   (cronbach alpha=.90) and a moderate level of interrater reliability
   (2-way mixed icc 0.65). overall, 11 out of the 12 reviewed apps met the
   minimum acceptable score of 3.0 in mars rating. the 3 apps with the
   highest combined scores were my kidneys, my health handbook (mars=4.68);

   prevention of fetal pathologies and unfavorable deliveries. however, the
   most commonly used cardiotocographic exam can be performed only in
   hospital-like structures and requires the supervision of expert
   personnel. for this reason, a wearable system able to continuously
   monitor fhr would be a noticeable step towards a personalized and remote
   pregnancy care. thanks to textile electrodes, miniaturized electronics,
   and smart devices like smartphones and tablets, we developed a wearable
   integrated system for everyday fetal monitoring during the last weeks of
   pregnancy. pregnant women at home can use it without the need for any
   external support by clinicians. the transmission of fhr to a specialized
   medical center allows its remote analysis, exploiting advanced
   algorithms running on high-performance hardware able to obtain the best
   classification of the fetal condition. the system has been tested on a
   limited set of pregnant women whose fetal electrocardiogram recordings
   were acquired and classified, yielding an overall score for both
   accuracy and sensitivity over 90\%. this novel approach can open a new
   perspective on the continuous monitoring of fetus development by
   enhancing the performance of regular examinations, making treatments

   methodological quality of studies assessing usability of mobile apps and
   to perform a preliminary analysis of of the scale's feasibility,

   usability of mobile apps. these items were used to write the scale and
   the guide to assist its use. the scale was then used to assess the
   quality of studies on usability of mobile apps for physical activity,
   and it assessed in terms of feasibility, interrater reliability, and
   construct validity.
   results: a total of 25 experts participated in the delphi panel, and a

   objective: the aim of this study was to describe the development,
   usability, acceptability, and feasibility of a new theory-and
   evidence-based smartphone app to promote an active lifestyle in
   lower-educated working young adults.
   methods: the new app was developed by applying 4 steps. first,
   determinants important to promote an active lifestyle in this population
   were selected. second, evidence-based behavior change techniques were
   selected to convert the determinants into practical applications. third,
   a new smartphone app was developed. fourth, volunteers (n=11, both lower
   and higher educated) tested the app on usability, and lower-educated
   working young adults (n=16) tested its acceptability and feasibility via
   (think aloud) interviews, a questionnaire, and google analytics. the app
   was accordingly adapted for the final version.
   results: a new android app, active coach, was developed that focused on
   knowledge, attitude, social support, and self-efficacy (based on
   outcomes from step 1), and that applied self-regulation techniques
   (based on outcomes from step 2). the app consists of a 9-week program

   usability test (eg, text errors, wrong messages) were all fixed. the
   acceptability and feasibility test showed that participants found the
   app clear, understandable, and motivating, although some aspects needed
   to be more personal.
   conclusions: by applying a stepwise, user-centered approach that
   regularly consulted the target group, the new app is adapted to their
   specific needs and preferences. the active coach app was overall
   positively evaluated by the lower-educated working young adults at the

  abstract       = {{prototyping (iterative loops of design-build-test) is a proven method of
   efficiently developing new products. developing products not only
   quickly, but that are also fit for purpose, implies engaging the end
   users and iterating the technology at hand. however, there is currently
   little research on how engineering design can approach developing
   connected devices. the purpose of this paper is to distinguish and
   discuss design approaches that are suitable for connected devices.
   internet of things devices consist of both the physical products
   themselves and the data that is coming out of the products, which we
   define as the external and internal data, respectively. they both can be
   prototyped separately, but since the data acquired can influence the
   design of the device and vice versa, we propose to link these two
   together in the product development process. this issue becomes more
   apparent when designing networks of sensors, e.g., for complex
   artificial intelligence (ai) databases. we explain the principle by
   describing the development of 1balance through six different prototypes
   for human balance measurement. technologically quantifying balance is an
   underused approach for objectively evaluating the state of a human's
   performance. the authors have developed a mobile application for
   monitoring balance as a physiological signal (amount of sway) via a
   compact wireless inertial measurement unit (imu) sensor strapped to the
   body of the subject for the duration of the measurement. we describe the
   design process for developing this connected medical device, as well as
   how the acquired data was used to improve the design of the product. in

  abstract             = {{introduction recent developments in smoking cessation support systems
   and interventions have highlighted the requirement for unobtrusive,
   passive ways to measure smoking behavior. a number of systems have been
   developed for this that either use bespoke sensing technology, or
   expensive combinations of wearables and smartphones. here, we present
   stopwatch, a system for passive detection of cigarette smoking that runs
   on a low-cost smartwatch and does not require additional sensing or a
   connected smartphone.
   methods our system uses motion data from the accelerometer and gyroscope
   in an android smartwatch to detect the signature hand movements of
   cigarette smoking. it uses machine learning techniques to transform raw
   motion data into motion features, and in turn into individual drags and
   instances of smoking. these processes run on the smartwatch, and do not
   require a smartphone.
   results we conducted preliminary validations of the system in daily
   smokers (n = 13) in laboratory and free-living conditions running on an
   android lg g-watch. in free-living conditions, over a 24-h period, the
   system achieved precision of 86\% and recall of 71\%.
   conclusions stopwatch is a system for passive measurement of cigarette
   smoking that runs entirely on a commercially available android
   smartwatch. it requires no smartphone so the cost is low, and needs no
   bespoke sensing equipment so participant burden is also low. performance
   is currently lower than other more expensive and complex systems, though
   adequate for some applications. future developments will focus on
   enhancing performance, validation on a range of smartwatches, and
   detection of electronic cigarette use.
   implications we present a low-cost, smartwatch-based system for passive
   detection of cigarette smoking. it uses data from the motion sensors in
   the watch to identify the signature hand movements of cigarette smoking.
   the system will provide the detailed measures of individual smoking
   behavior needed for context-triggered just-in-time smoking cessation
   support systems, and to enable just-in-time adaptive interventions. more
   broadly, the system will enable researchers to obtain detailed measures
   of individual smoking behavior in free-living conditions that are free
   from the recall errors and reporting biases associated with self-report
   of smoking.}},

  abstract       = {{background: chronic pain conditions are complicated and challenging to
   live with. electronic health (ehealth) interventions show promise in
   helping people cope with chronic illness, including pain. the success of
   these interventions depends not only on the technology and intervention
   content but also on the users' acceptance and adherence. involving all
   stakeholders (eg, patients, spouses, health care providers, designers,
   software developers, and researchers) and exploring their input and
   preferences in the design and development process is an important step
   toward developing meaningful interventions and possibly strengthening
   treatment outcomes.
   objective: the aim of this study was to design and develop a
   user-centered, evidence-based ehealth self-management intervention for
   people with chronic pain.
   methods: the study employed a multidisciplinary and user-centered design
   approach. overall, 20 stakeholders from the project team (ie, 7
   researchers, 5 editors, 7 software developers, and 1 user
   representative), together with 33 external stakeholders (ie, 12 health
   care providers, 1 health care manger, 1 ehealth research psychologist,
   and 17 patients with chronic pain and 2 of their spouses) participated
   in a user-centered development process that included workshops,
   intervention content development, and usability testing. intervention
   content was developed and finalized based on existing evidence,
   stakeholder input, and user testing. stakeholder input was examined
   through qualitative analyses with rapid and in-depth analysis
   approaches.
   results: analyses from stakeholder input identified themes including a
   need for reliable, trustworthy, and evidence-based content,
   personalization, options for feedback, behavioral tracking, and
   self-assessment/registration as factors to include in the intervention.
   evidence based intervention content development resulted in one
   face-to-face introduction session and 9 app-based educational and
   exercise-based modules. usability testing provided further insight into
   how to optimize the design of the intervention to the user group,
   identifying accessibility and a simple design to be essential.
   conclusions: the design and development process of ehealth interventions
   should strive to combine well-known evidence-based concepts with
   stakeholder input. this study, designing and developing the pain
   management intervention epio, illustrates how a stakeholder-centered
   design approach can provide essential input in the development of an
   ehealth self-management intervention for people with chronic pain.}},

  abstract      = {{background: given the demanding nature of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
   (ohca) resuscitations, recordings of the times of interventions in ems
   patient care reports (pcrs) are often inaccurate. the american heart
   association developed full code pro (fcp), a smartphone application
   designed to assist ems personnel in recording the timing of
   interventions performed. through ohca simulations, this study assessed
   the group size necessary to use the fcp recording functions accurately
   and safely without compromising patient care. program evaluation was
   based on participant feedback surveys, data accuracy, delays between
   recording and performing interventions, and delays in care attributed to
   using the application, stratified by group size. methods: simulations of
   a standard ohca scenario using the gaumard traumahal mannequin and a
   dedicated iphone 5 preloaded with fcp version 3.4 were run with group
   sizes of 2-6 participants, with group sizes determined by participant
   availability. participants included connecticut certified paramedics and
   paramedic students who had completed the appropriate coursework. a
   7-item feedback survey using a likert scale established participant
   feedback on the application. videos of the simulations were analyzed to
   assess for delays. one-way analysis of variance with trend analysis was
   used to test whether outcomes differed by group size and whether
   differences tended in one direction in parallel with group size.
   results: there were 37 simulations, including 142 participants. the
   feedback survey questions achieved a cronbach's alpha of 0.91,
   signifying high reliability, and demonstrated a linear trend supporting
   greater satisfaction with fcp as group size increases (p < 0.001).
   similarly, increasing group size displayed linear trends with greater
   numbers of interventions recorded (p = 0.009) and fewer missed and false
   recordings (p = 0.002). delays revealed significant linear trends (p =
   0.018 for delays in recording and p < 0.001 for delays in care), as
   increasing group size corresponded with lesser delays. greatest
   improvement was noted to be between groups of 3 and 4 participants.
   conclusions: ohca simulations using fcp demonstrate increased provider
   comfort, increased recording accuracy, and decreased delays as the group
   size increased. while the application may improve recordings for pcrs
   and future research, the data suggest a sufficient number of ems
   personnel (>3) should be present to achieve reliable data without
   compromising patient care.}},

   short in finding them. in this paper, we identify four anti-patterns of

   usability and feasibility by primary level workers in a remote setting
   in kenya.
   methods: eleven sites comprising one sub-district hospital, ten health
   centres and dispensaries were selected in three districts of kisumu
   county to participate. two health workers per site were selected,
   trained over a two-day period in the use of the deki reader (tm) to
   undertake rapid diagnostic testing (rdt) for malaria and data capture of
   patients' records. health managers in the three districts were trained
   in the use of fionet (tm) portal (web portal to cloud based information)
   to access the data uploaded by the deki readers. field support was
   provided by the fio corporation representative in kenya.
   results: a total of 5812 malaria rdts were run and uploaded to the cloud
   database during this implementation research study. uploaded data were
   automatically aggregated into predetermined reports for use by service
   managers and supervisors. the deki reader enhanced the performance of
   the health workers by not only guiding them through processing of a
   malaria rdt test, but also by doing the automated analysis of the rdt,
   capturing the image, determining whether the rdt was processed according
   to guidelines, and capturing full patient data for each patient
   encounter. supervisors were able to perform remote quality
   assurance/quality control (qa/qc) activities almost in real time.
   conclusion: quality, complete and timely data collection by health

   alkaline/surfactant/polymer (asp) enhanced-oil-recovery projects because
   of its low molar mass and the possibility for it to be delivered as a
   liquid. on an offshore platform, space and weight savings can be the
   determining factor in deciding whether an asp project is feasible.
   logistics may also be critical in determining the economic feasibility
   of projects in remote locations.
   ammonia as alkali together with a surfactant blend of alkyl propoxy
   sulfate/internal olefin sulfonate (aps/ios) functions as an effective
   alkali. surfactant adsorption is low, and oil recovery in corefloods is
   high. static adsorption tests show that low surfactant adsorption is
   attained at ph >9, a condition that ammonia satisfies at low solution
   concentration.
   it is expected that ammonia has a performance deficiency relative to
   sodium carbonate in that it does not precipitate calcium from solution.
   calcium accumulation in the ammonia asp solution will occur, caused by
   ion exchange from clays. the high oil recovery for ammonia and the
   calcium accumulation in asp and surfactant/polymer corefloods with
   aps/ios blends show that this surfactant system is effective and
   calcium-tolerant. also, phase behavior and interfacial-tension (ift)
   measurements suggest that aps/ios blends remain effective in the
   presence of calcium. ethylene oxide/propylene oxide sulfates (such as
   the used aps) are known commercially available, calcium-tolerant
   surfactants. however, because of hydrolysis, sulfate-type surfactants
   are suitable for use only in lower-temperature reservoirs.
   very different behavior was noticed for phase-behavior measurements with
   calcium-intolerant surfactants such as alkyl benzene sulfonates and ios.
   in this case, calcium addition results in a very high ift and complete
   separation of oil and brine. presumably, this will result in low oil
   recovery. a preferred approach for asp offshore with
   divalent-ion-intolerant surfactants may be the use of a hybrid alkali
   system combining the attributes of sodium carbonate and ammonia. the
   concept is to supply the bulk of the alkalinity for an asp flood by
   ammonia with all the inherent logistical advantages. a minor quantity of
   sodium carbonate is added to the formulation to specifically precipitate
   calcium ions.}},

  abstract       = {{background: standard care for the rehabilitation of knee conditions
   involves exercise programs and information provision. current methods of
   rehabilitation delivery struggle to keep up with large volumes of
   patients and the length of treatment required to maximize the recovery.
   therefore, the development of novel interventions to support
   self-management is strongly recommended. such interventions need to
   include information provision, goal setting, monitoring, feedback, and
   support groups, but the most effective methods of their delivery are
   poorly understood. the internet provides a medium for intervention
   delivery with considerable potential for meeting these needs.
   objective: the objective of this study was to demonstrate the
   feasibility of a web-based app and to conduct a preliminary review of
   its practicability as part of a complex medical intervention in the
   rehabilitation of knee disorders. this paper describes the development,
   implementation, and usability of such an app.
   methods: an interdisciplinary team of health care professionals and
   researchers, computer scientists, and app developers developed the trak
   app suite. the key functionality of the app includes information
   provision, a three-step exercise program based on a standard care for
   the rehabilitation of knee conditions, self-monitoring with visual
   feedback, and a virtual support group. there were two types of
   stakeholders (patients and physiotherapists) that were recruited for the
   usability study. the usability questionnaire was used to collect both
   qualitative and quantitative information on computer and internet usage,
   task completion, and subjective user preferences.
   results: a total of 16 patients and 15 physiotherapists participated in
   the usability study. based on the system usability scale, the trak app
   has higher perceived usability than 70\% of systems. both patients and
   physiotherapists agreed that the given web-based approach would
   facilitate communication, provide information, help recall information,
   improve understanding, enable exercise progression, and support
   self-management in general. the web app was found to be easy to use and
   user satisfaction was very high. the trak app suite can be accessed at
   http://apps.facebook.com/neetrak/.

   before young adulthood, with the majority of acts occurring in private.
   mobile apps may offer a way of providing support for young people at
   times of distress to prevent self-harm.
   objective: this is a proof-of-concept study designed to explore the
   safety, acceptability, feasibility, and usability of a smartphone app,
   blueice, with young people who are self-harming.
   methods: in this phase i open trial we will evaluate blueice, a
   smartphone app developed and coproduced with young people with lived
   experience of self-harm. blueice includes a mood-monitoring diary,
   selection of mood-lifting techniques based on cognitive behavior therapy
   and dialectical behavior therapy, and direct access to emergency
   telephone numbers. we will recruit young people (n=50) attending
   specialist child and adolescent mental health services with a current or
   past history of self-harm to trial blueice as an adjunct to their usual
   care. questionnaires and interviews will be completed at baseline,
   postfamiliarization (2 weeks), and at follow-up (12 weeks after
   baseline) to assess safety, app use, and acceptability. interviews will
   be undertaken with clinicians to assess the feasibility of blueice
   within a clinical setting.
   results: recruitment occurred between may and november 2016. the
   recruitment target was 50, and by the beginning of november 54 young
   people had been referred.
   conclusions: this study is the first to evaluate an app specifically
   developed with young people for young people (under the age of 18 years)
   who self-harm. it will determine whether blueice is acceptable, how
   often it is used, and whether it is safe and does not have any
   unintentional adverse effects. this information will determine whether a
   feasibility trial to test recruitment, randomization, retention, and
   appropriate outcome measures should be pursued.}},

   morbidity and mortality worldwide. early diagnosis is of pivotal
   importance for patients with cardiac arrhythmias and ischemia to
   minimize the consequences like strokes and myocardial infarctions. the
   chance of capturing signals of arrhythmias or ischemia is substantially
   high when a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ecg) can be recorded at the
   moment when a patient experiences the symptoms. however, until now,
   available diagnostic systems (holter monitors and other wearable ecg
   sensors) have not enabled patients to record a reliable 12-lead ecg at
   home.
   objective: the objective of this project was to develop a user-friendly
   system that enables persons with cardiac complaints to record a reliable
   12-lead ecg at home to improve the diagnostic process and, consequently,
   reduce the time between the onset of symptoms and adequate treatment.
   methods: using an iterative design approach, ecgraph was developed. the
   system consists of an ecg measurement system and a mobile app, which
   were developed with the help of several concept tests. to evaluate the
   design, a prototype of the final design was built and a final technical
   performance test and usability test were executed.
   results: the ecg measurement system consists of a belt and 4 limb
   straps. ten wet ag/agcl electrodes are placed in the belt to optimize
   skin-electrode contact. the product is controlled via an app on the
   mobile phone of the user. once a person experiences symptoms, he or she
   can put on the belt and record ecgs within a few minutes. short
   instructions, supported by visualizations, offer guidance during use.
   ecgs are sent wirelessly to the caregiver, and the designated expert can
   quickly interpret the results. usability tests with the final prototype
   (n=6) showed that the participants were able to put on the product
   within 8 minutes during first-time use. however, we expect that the
   placement of the product can be executed faster when the user becomes
   more familiar with the product. areas of improvement focus mainly on
   confidence during product use. in the technical performance test, a
   12-lead ecg was made and reproduced 6 times.
   conclusions: we developed a new 12-lead ecg system for home use. the
   product is expected to be more user-friendly than current hospital ecg
   systems and is designed to record more reliable data than current ecg
   systems for home use, which makes it suitable for expert interpretation.
   the system has great potential to be incorporated into an outpatient
   practice, so that arrhythmias and ischemia can be diagnosed and treated
   as early as possible.}},

  abstract          = {{the potential opportunities for fuel cost and emissions reduction as a
   result of converting from diesel to natural gas (ng) are well known in
   the rail industry. recent developments in domestic sources for petroleum
   have both lowered the cost and stabilized the natural gas market making
   the adoption of no more strategically viable than ever before. no engine
   conversion systems for medium speed diesel engines have been available
   for over 20 years and environmental incentives are helping to further
   support the adoption of ng not only as an alternate fuel, but possibly
   as the new primary fuel. the major challenge for railroad transition to
   no is now to develop a manageable and cost effective on board storage
   architecture with capacity to provide sufficient range to meet industry
   acceptance for general use.
   for long haul applications, the solution has been to add a large
   locomotive ng tender. for short line, switcher and commuter
   applications, the fuel cost benefits do not warrant the cost and
   complexity of such a system. for these short to medium range
   applications, an ``on locomotive{''} storage system with a capacity
   equivalent to a minimum of 500 diesel gallons is a better solution. this
   paper summarizes the development of a crashworthy, high capacity,
   underfrarne ng storage solution packaged in the form factor normally
   occupied by the conventional locomotive diesel fuel tank (fig. 1).
   primary challenges for the cng storage system solution are to achieve
   high storage density and crashworthiness while within the confines of
   existing aar m-1001plate c profile. it is expected that the system is to
   meet both the cfr/fra structural requirements for diesel tanks and
   relevant dot requirements for cng cylinders used in mobile applications.
   the ng storage system presented consists of an outer enclosure which
   mounts to the locomotive similarly to the existing diesel fuel tank. the
   enclosure contains and interfaces with ng cylinders specifically
   designed for the application. the system design withstands the various
   load requirements defined in 49 cfr part 238 appendix d, that simulate
   both jackknife derailment and class 8 truck side impact scenarios. ng
   cylinders within the enclosure must be approved for use in this
   application and have sufficient capacity and maintainability to create
   new opportunities for no conversion in the rail industry. the primary
   design goal for the storage system is to integrate the cylinder size and
   configuration within the enclosure such that storage volume is maximized
   and crash impact loads are minimized impact loads are distributed
   through the system ensuring that point loading sufficient to breach one
   or more of the no cylinders or fuel lines does not occur. an overview of
   the development and results of physical derailment and side impact
   testing performed in support of this effort are presented.}},

   test (6wt) are increasingly applied to evaluate patients with
   degenerative diseases of the lumbar spine before and after (surgical)
   treatment. however, the traditional 6wt is cumbersome to apply, as it
   requires specialized in-hospital infrastructure and personnel. the
   authors set out to compare 6-minute walking distance (6wd) measurements
   obtained with a newly developed smartphone application (app) and those
   obtained with the gold-standard distance wheel (dw).
   methods the authors developed a free ios- and android-based smartphone
   app that allows patients to measure the 6wd in their home environment
   using global positioning system (gps) coordinates. in a laboratory
   setting, the authors obtained 6wd measurements over a range of
   smartphone models, testing environments, and walking patterns and
   speeds. the main outcome was the relative measurement error (rme; in
   percent of 6wd), with vertical bar rme vertical bar< 7.5\% defined as
   reliable. the intraclass correlation coefficient (icc) for agreement
   between app- and dw-based 6wd was calculated.
   results measurements (n = 406) were reliable with all smartphone types
   in neighborhood, nature, and city environments (without high buildings),
   as well as with unspecified, straight, continuous, and stop-and-go
   walking patterns (icc = 0.97, 95\% ci 0.97-0.98, p < 0.001).
   measurements were unreliable indoors, in city areas with high buildings,
   and for predominantly rectangular walking courses. walking speed had an
   influence on the me, with worse accuracy (2\% higher rme) for every
   kilometer per hour slower walking pace (95\% ci 1.4\%-2.5\%, p < 0.001).
   mathematical adjustment of the app-based 6wd for velocity-dependent
   error mitigated the rme (p < 0.011), attenuated velocity dependence (p =
   0.362), and had a positive effect on accuracy (icc = 0.98, 95\% ci
   0.98-0.99, p < 0.001).
   conclusions the new, free, spine-specific 6wt smartphone app measures
   the 6wd conveniently by using gps coordinates, empowering patients to
   independently determine their functional status before and after
   (surgical) treatment. measurements of 6wd obtained for the target
   population under the recommended circumstances are highly reliable.}},

  abstract       = {{background: identifying scalable strategies for assessing fidelity is a
   key challenge in implementation science. however, for psychosocial
   interventions, the existing, reliable ways to test treatment fidelity
   quality are often labor intensive, and less burdensome strategies may
   not reflect actual clinical practice. cognitive behavioral therapies
   (cbts) provide clinicians with a set of effective core elements to help
   treat a multitude of disorders, which, evidence suggests, need to be
   delivered with fidelity to maximize potential client impact. the current
   ``gold standard{''} for rating cbts is rating recordings of therapy
   sessions, which is extremely time-consuming and requires a substantial
   amount of initial training. although cbts can vary based on the target
   disorder, one common element employed in most cbts is the use of
   worksheets to identify specific behaviors and thoughts that affect a
   client's ability to recover. the present study will develop and evaluate
   an innovative new approach to rate cbt fidelity, by developing a
   universal cbt scoring system based on worksheets completed in therapy
   sessions.
   methods: to develop a scoring system for cbt worksheets, we will compile
   common cbt elements from a variety of cbt worksheets for a range of
   psychiatric disorders and create adherence and competence measures. we
   will collect archival worksheets from past studies to test the scoring
   system and assess test-retest reliability. to evaluate whether cbt
   worksheet scoring accurately reflects clinician fidelity, we will
   recruit clinicians who are engaged in a cbt for depression, anxiety,
   and/or posttraumatic stress disorder. clinicians and clients will
   transmit routine therapy materials produced in session (e.g.,
   worksheets, clinical notes, session recordings) to the study team after
   each session. we will compare observer-rated fidelity, clinical notes,
   and fidelity-rated worksheets to identify the most effective and
   efficient method to assess clinician fidelity. clients will also be
   randomly assigned to either complete the cbt worksheets on paper forms
   or on a mobile application (app) to learn if worksheet format influences
   clinician and client experience or differs in terms of reflecting
   fidelity.
   discussion: scoring fidelity using cbt worksheets may allow clinics to
   test fidelity in a short and effective manner, enhancing continuous
   quality improvement in the workplace. clinicians and clinics can use
   such data to improve clinician fidelity in real time, leading to
   improved patient outcomes.

   design/methodology/approach - this study uses data randomly derived from
   a panel of one million uk consumers, analyzed via structural equations
   modeling. the unit of analysis was individual apps prominently
   displaying a brand identity. the study tested indirect relationships
   between the key drivers considered and usage intention via perceived
   usefulness and ease of use.
   findings - consumers who view branded apps as protecting their privacy,
   customizable and compatible with what they do, will have stronger
   perceptions of usefulness and ease of use and greater intention to use
   the app. these effects also occur indirectly. furthermore, usage
   intention drives the willingness to recommend the app and to pay to
   continue using it.
   practical implications - to influence usage intention, managers can
   improve the perception of usefulness of branded apps by protecting
   consumer privacy and improving the app's design and its compatibility
   with people's needs and lifestyle. managers can also enhance the
   perception of ease of use of the branded app by heightening its security

   indirectly) the intention to use the app, which will lead to the
   willingness to recommend the app and pay for it.
   originality/value - this study extends previous research by examining
   factors driving the intention to use branded apps and the resulting

   diseases are always complex. in this context, mobile technologies have
   been used with promising results, but often have restricted
   functionality, or are either difficult to use or do not provide the
   necessary support to the caregiver - which leads to declining usage over
   time. therefore, we developed the mobile system for elderly monitoring,
   smai. the purpose of smai is to monitor patients with functional loss
   and to improve the support to caregivers' communication with the health
   team professionals, informing them the data related to the patients'
   daily lives, while providing the health team better tools.methodsmai is
   composed of mobile applications developed for the caregivers and health
   team, and a web portal that supports management activities. caregivers
   use an android application to send information and receive care advice
   and feedback from the health team. the system was constructed using a
   refinement stage approach. each stage involved caregivers and the health
   team in prototype release-test-assessment-refinement cycles. smai was
   evaluated during 18 months. we studied which features were being used
   the most, and their use pattern throughout the week. we also studied the
   users' qualitative perceptions. finally, the caregiver application was
   also evaluated for usability.resultssmai functionalities showed to be
   very useful or useful to caregivers and health professionals. the focus
   group interviews reveled that among caregivers the use of the
   application gave them the sensation of being connected to the health
   team. the usability evaluation identified that the interface design and
   associated tasks were easy to use and the system usability scale, sus,
   presented very good results.conclusionsin general, the use of smai
   represented a positive change for the family caregivers and for the nai
   health team. the overall qualitative results indicate that the approach

   and communication technologies (ict) in education. an e-learning
   platform is a web-based software and represents an important tool for
   educators to create and manage courses on the web. however, due to the
   close relation of e-learning with the internet, such platforms are
   cyber-threatened and recent attacks have increasingly targeted platforms
   vulnerable to cryptojacking, a technique used for mining
   cryptocurrencies using the computing resources of devices from
   unsuspecting users. the number of educational web platforms has
   increased in the last years, and are now widespread in the mobile
   applications environment to reach a broad audience of users. the use of
   e-learning mobile applications (m-learning) enables employees to enrich
   their professional knowledge on their terms, whenever they want, by
   ensuring easy access to the learning material available on cloud
   platforms using any kind of internet connection. the problem analyzed in
   the paper is related to the security of these m-learning applications
   when connecting to public wi-fi network at a hotel or library, as an
   example of an unsecured network, while an office network is usually
   considered as secure. our goal is to identify and mitigate the risks
   when users connect to a wi-fi public network, and also analyze how
   vulnerable devices are exposed to cybercriminals, as hackers can
   intercept communications between mobile devices such as smartphones or
   tablets using public wi-fi hotspots, namely a man-in-the-middle (mitm)
   attack. furthermore, we evaluate several open source penetration testing
   tools which aid to the identification of vulnerabilities and propose
   proper security solutions for e-learning platforms in the context of

   approach to measure sport-related concussion (src) symptoms, explore the
   relationships between clinical outcomes and mema, and determine whether
   mema was advantageous for predicting recovery outcomes compared to
   traditional symptom report.
   setting: outpatient concussion clinic.
   participants: 20 athletes aged 12 to 19 years with src.
   methods: prospective study of mema surveys assessing activity and
   symptoms delivered via mobile application (3 time blocks daily) and
   clinical assessment at visit 1 (<72 hours postinjury) and visit 2 (6-18
   days postinjury). linear mixed models examined changes in mema symptoms
   over time and relationships among simultaneous report of activity type
   (cognitive, physical, sedentary, vestibular) and symptoms. linear
   regressions evaluated the association among symptoms for activity types
   and clinical outcomes.
   main measures: mema symptom scores, post-concussion symptom scale,
   neurocognitive testing, vestibular/oculomotor screening (voms).
   results: mema response rate was 52.4\% (n = 1155) for prompts and 50.4\%
   per participant. symptoms were lower in the morning (p < .001) compared
   with afternoon and evening. higher mema symptoms were reported during
   vestibular compared with physical (p = .035) and sedentary (p = .001)
   activities. mema symptoms were positively associated with
   post-concussion symptom scale (pcss) (p = .007), voms (p = 0.001-0.002),
   and recovery time (p < .001), but not neurocognitive scores. mema
   symptom score (p = .021) was a better predictor of recovery time than
   pcss at either clinic visit.
   conclusion: mema overcomes barriers of traditional symptom scales by
   eliminating retrospective bias and capturing fluctuations in symptoms by
   time of day and activity type, ultimately helping clinicians refine
   symptom management strategies.}},

   proposed methods, we can trigger the alarm if we detect an android app

   detected malware on a broader scale. we provide a detailed description
   of the proposed detection methods and related algorithms. we include an
   extensive analysis to assess the suitability of our proposed
   similarity-based detection methods. in this way, we perform our
   experiments on three datasets, including benign and malware android apps
   like drebin, contagio, and genome. thus, to corroborate the actual
   effectiveness of our classifier, we carry out performance comparisons
   with some state-of-the-art classification and malware detection
   algorithms, namely mixed and separated solutions, the program
   dissimilarity measure based on entropy (pdme) and the faldroid
   algorithms. we test our experiments in a different type of features:
   api, intent, and permission features on these three datasets. the
   results confirm that accuracy rates of proposed algorithms are more than
   90\% and in some cases (i.e., considering api features) are more than
   99\%, and are comparable with existing state-of-the-art solutions. (c)

  abstract          = {{since several years ago, many semiconductors companies have invested a
   lot of efforts and resources in the wire bonding conversion from gold
   (au) wire to copper (cu) wire in order to achieve the most competitive
   cost. meanwhile, the fast growing mobile application and industry
   continues to leap forwards with miniaturization especially in the most
   popular qfn (quad flat no-lead) packages. from multiple analysis, it
   looks like breakthrough competitive edge will depend on the success of
   running wire bonding process of both wire types (au \& cu) with the
   ultimate ultra-fine pitch (uufp) process on the flimsy qfn leadframes.
   this new process can aim for targeted pitch size of 20um which is the
   smallest possible in the industry, and most likely it will become the
   ultimate pitch size for now and future. there are many challenges in the
   development of such process with major considerations and evaluations
   focusing on various designs, hardware, machine capability, process
   constraints, process control and amplification of respective au and cu
   wire process issues. the uufp process is firstly started with design
   considerations on both direct and indirect material. from the
   discussions with major bonding wire suppliers, current feasible wire
   size of au wire is 0.4 mils and cu wire size is 0.5 mils. with both
   wires selected, next design consideration is the capillary design. the
   capillary tip needs to be the smallest possible together with the
   tightest tolerance of every major dimension. these requirements resulted
   in extremely tedious fabrication process which requires new molding tool
   and process enhancement. furthermore, such small capillary can also
   encounter robustness issue due to the thin capillary wall and dimension
   tolerances. upon receiving the wire and capillary, the subsequent
   challenge is the machine capability. there are two important
   considerations, resolution of process parameters (ultrasonic power and
   force) and bonding placement accuracy. in the previous development of
   30/35 um pitch, whereby it was found that bond force requirement already
   hitting only several grams. it is expecting that the uufp process will
   require even more stringent process window. it is expected few 0.1 gram
   force may result in significant change in the wire bonding responses.
   despite that, the conventional process issues will get worse, which
   include resonance effect of qfn wire bonding, au wire challenges (imc
   growth, reliability risk) and cu wire challenges (lifted ball, crater,
   short-tail). therefore, the process window development can be extremely
   difficult. in order to obtain better success rate, comprehensive six
   sigma method is highly recommended. upon completion of process window
   development, a series of robustness tests should be performed. there are
   some unique robustness tests which can disclose any potential issue or
   risk. upon completion of bonding success, the bonded units will be
   loaded into reliability test for standard tests and extended tests.
   sometimes, the entire development process may need to be repeated from
   the beginning design phase if there is any stubborn quality issue. with
   the utilization of comprehensive methodology, the new uufp process is
   applicable to full production mode in near future. this process is
   believed to be the ultimate process for wire bonding pitch, for both au
   \& cu wire types.}},

  abstract       = {{android usually employs the secure socket layer (ssl) protocol to
   protect the user's privacy in network transmission. however, developers
   may misuse ssl-related apis, which would lead attackers to steal user's
   privacy through man-in-the-middle attacks. existing methods based on
   static decompiling technology to detect ssl security vulnerabilities of
   android applications cannot cope with the increasingly common packed
   applications. meanwhile, dynamic analysis approaches have the
   disadvantages of excessive resource consumption and time-consuming. in
   this paper, we propose a dynamic method to solve this issue based on our
   novel automatic traversal model. at first, we propose several new
   traversal strategies to optimize the widget tree according to the user
   interface (ui) types and the interface state similarity. furthermore, we
   develop a more granular traversal model by refining the traversal level
   from the activity component to the widget and implement a heuristic
   depth-first traversal algorithm in combination with our customized
   traversal strategy. in addition, the man-in-the-middle agent plug-in is
   extended to implement real-time attack test and return the attack
   results. based on the above ideas, we have implemented ssldetecter, an
   efficient automated detection system of android application ssl security
   vulnerability. we apply it on multiple devices in parallel to detect
   2456 popular applications in several mainstream application markets and
   find that 424 applications are suffering from ssl security
   vulnerabilities. compared with the existing system smv-hunter, the time
   efficiency of our system increases by 38\% and the average detection
   rate increases by 6.39 percentage points, with many types of ssl
   vulnerabilities detected.}},

  abstract             = {{background: breastfeeding has many benefits for newborns, mothers, and
   the wider society. the world health organization recommends mothers to
   feed newborns exclusively with breastmilk for the first 6 months after
   birth, but breastfeeding rates in many countries fail to align with the
   recommendations because of various barriers. breastfeeding success is
   associated with a number of determinants, such as self-efficacy,
   intention to breastfeed, and attitudes toward breastfeeding. information
   and communication technology (ict) has been leveraged to support
   breastfeeding by means of improving knowledge or providing practical
   supports in different maternal stages. previous reviews have examined
   and summarized the effectiveness and credibility of interventions;
   however, no review has been done from a human-computer interaction
   perspective that is concerned with novel interaction techniques and the
   perspective of end users.
   objective: the objective of this review was to provide a comprehensive
   overview of existing digital interventions that support breastfeeding by
   investigating systems' objective, technology design, validation process,
   and quality attributes, both in terms of clinical parameters as well as
   usability and user experience.
   methods: a systematic search was conducted in accordance with preferred
   reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines in
   the following libraries: pubmed, science direct, association for
   computing machinery digital library (acm digital library), and institute
   of electrical and electronics engineers xplore (ieee xplore).
   results: a total of 35 papers discussing 30 interventions were included.
   the main goals of these interventions were organized into 4 categories:
   breastfeeding education (n=12), breastfeeding promotion (n=8),
   communication support (n=6), and daily practical support (n=4). of the
   interventions, 13 target mothers in the postnatal period. most
   interventions come in forms of client communication systems (n=18),
   which frequently leverage web technologies, text message, and mobile
   apps to provide breastfeeding support. systems predominantly focus on
   mothers; validation strategies were rather heterogeneous, with 12 user
   studies concerning usability and user experience and 18 clinical
   validation studies focusing on the effects of the interventions on
   breastfeeding determinants; 5 papers did not report results. generally,
   straightforward systems (eg, communication tools or web based solutions)
   seem to be more effective than complex interventions (eg, games).
   conclusions: existing information and communication systems offer
   effective means of improving breastfeeding outcomes, but they do not
   address all relevant periods in parenthood (eg, the antenatal period)
   and often do not involve important stakeholders, such as partners. there
   is an opportunity to leverage more complex technical systems to open up
   avenues for the broader design of ict to support breastfeeding; however,
   considering evaluation outcomes of existing support systems of higher
   complexity, such systems need to be designed with care.}},

   12-week standard smoking cessation support program is available,
   however, its required face-to-face visits are a key obstacle in
   completing the program. telemedicine is a useful way to provide medical
   treatment at a distance. although telemedicine for smoking cessation
   using an internet-based video system has the potential for ensuring
   better clinical outcomes for patients with nicotine dependence, its

   objective: the aim of this study is to determine the efficacy and
   feasibility of a smoking cessation support program using an
   internet-based video system compared with a face-to-face program among
   patients with nicotine dependence.
   methods: this study will be a randomized, controlled, open-label,
   multicenter trial. participants randomized to the intervention arm will
   undergo an internet-based smoking cessation program, whereas control
   participants will undergo a standard face-to-face program. we will use
   the cureapp smoking cessation (casc) for both arms, which consists of
   the casc smartphone app for patients and a web-based patient information
   management system for clinicians with a mobile carbon monoxide checking
   device. the primary endpoint will be the continuous abstinence rate
   (car) from weeks 9 to 12. secondary endpoints will be: (1) the smoking
   cessation success rate at 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks; (2) car from weeks 9
   to 24; (3) changes in scores on the mood and physical symptoms scale and
   12-item french version of the tobacco craving questionnaire; (4) kano
   test for social nicotine dependence scores at 8, 12, and 24 weeks; (5)
   time to first lapse after the first visit; (6) nicotine dependence and
   cognition scale scores at 12 and 24 weeks; (7) usage rate of the casc;
   (8) qualitative questionnaire about the usability and acceptability of
   telemedicine; and (9) presence of product problems or adverse events.
   results: we will recruit 114 participants who are nicotine-dependent but
   otherwise healthy adults from march to july 2018 and follow up with them
   until january 2019 (24 weeks). we expect all study results to be
   available by the end of march 2019.
   conclusions: this will be the first randomized controlled trial to
   evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of an internet-based
   (telemedicine) smoking cessation support program relative to a
   face-to-face program among patients with nicotine dependence. we expect
   that the efficacy of the telemedicine smoking cessation support program
   will not be clinically worse than the face-to-face program. if this
   trial demonstrates that telemedicine does not have clinically worse
   efficacy and feasibility than a conventional face-to-face program,
   physicians can begin to offer a more flexible smoking cessation program
   to patients who may otherwise give up on trying such programs.}},

   was mostly consistent between the two trials. this study therefore
   confirmed: 1) the value of including patient-users not only in

   these deaths occurs in developing countries due to inaccessibility of
   hospitals or lack of resources. blood culture is the test to confirm
   sepsis, but it requires the presence of laboratory and is
   time-consuming. therefore, we require simple, easy to use methods to
   predict sepsis in homes. majority of the available prediction models
   need invasive parameters and hence become useless in the rural areas of
   developing countries where laboratory facilities do not exist.
   non-invasive prediction models overcome these challenges to predict
   neonatal sepsis in places where there is a scarcity of laboratories. the
   aim and objective of this study are as follows: (i) to develop a
   practical, non-invasive prediction-model for neonatal sepsis which can
   be used in the rural areas of developing countries and to validate its
   performance. (ii) to compare the prognostic performance of the
   non-invasive prediction model with invasive prediction model and (iii)
   to create a prototype of the hardware which calculates the probability
   of the sepsis in neonates and sends the real-time data to the cloud. for
   this retrospective analysis, we extracted the data of 1446 neonates from
   medical information mart for intensive care iii (mimic) database. using
   stepwise logistic regression analysis, we developed and validated two
   prediction models. these two models were named as model ni and model o.
   model o contains invasive as well as non-invasive parameters whereas
   model ni contains only non-invasive parameters. model ni performed
   equally well in comparison to model o despite using different
   predictors. the area under roc curves for model ni and model o were

   promoting health and reducing the cost of care. although data can be
   kept encrypted in servers, the user does not have the ability to decide
   whom the data are shared with. technically this is linked to the problem
   of who owns the data encryption keys required to decrypt the data.
   currently, cloud service providers, rather than users, have full rights
   to the key. in practical terms this makes the users lose full control
   over their data. trust and uptake of these applications can be increased
   by allowing patients to feel in control of their data, generally stored
   in cloud-based services.
   objective: this paper addresses this security challenge by providing the
   user a way of controlling encryption keys independently of the cloud
   service provider. we provide a secure and usable system that enables a
   patient to share health information with doctors and specialists.
   methods: we contribute a secure protocol for patients to share their
   data with doctors and others on the cloud while keeping complete
   ownership. we developed a simple, stereotypical health application and
   carried out security tests, performance tests, and usability tests with
   both students and doctors (n=15).
   results: we developed the health application as an app for android

   participants and medical professionals. of 20 participants, 14 (70\%)
   either agreed or strongly agreed that they felt safer using our system.

   conclusions: we presented a security protocol that enables patients to
   securely share their ehealth data with doctors and nurses and developed

   teaching and learning, the authors examined current literature and
   collected data through observations, semi-structured interviews, and by
   observing the needit underlying database. the study attempted to answer
   the following questions: 1) how can mobile technology be used to support
   students' ideation? 2) what obstacles are there in developing students'
   ideation within this context? 3) how can the methods be further
   developed or refined? 4) what are the benefits of using mobile
   technology for ideation in schools? the study also highlighted the
   importance of teaching students to differentiate between problem-needs
   to be independently identified by students within their home or
   community environment and possible solutions to be developed and
   evaluated in collaboration with the classroom teacher. the application
   has proved to be valuable for its intended use; however it needs to be
   further developed so that it may also be used as a medium in
   establishing course content based on students'homework assignments
   passed electronically to school. the perceived overall value of mobile
   technology in schools lies partly in the multifaceted capabilities
   associated with this modern technology and novel attempts have been made
   to employ its use in many different educational settings.}},

   platforms. however, the extant literature focuses primarily on why app
   developers join-not leave-a platform. this app-level study develops two
   ideas: (a) coordination costs borne by an app's developer are associated
   with platform desertion, and (b) these costs are, in turn, shaped by a
   nuanced interplay between app decision rights and app
   ``microarchitecture{''} introduced here. we use survey and snapshot
   archival data spanning 2009-2014 on over 300 apps in the mozilla firefox
   ecosystem to test these ideas. our novel contribution shows how, by
   influencing coordination costs, the previously invisible interplay
   between app decision rights and app microarchitecture shapes an app's
   platform desertion. we find that delegating app decision rights to its
   developer weakens the coordination cost-reducing benefits of decoupling
   an app from the platform but strengthens those of standardizing its
   interfaces to the platform. the key theoretical implication is that app
   decision rights and app microarchitecture symbiotically influence the
   coordination costs borne by an app's developer. the key practical
   implication for platform designers is that the choices about who ought
   to make what decisions are intertwined with the architecture of the

   over an arbitrary distance and at an arbitrary scale to a remote
   workplace. a telerobotic system that is transparent enables a natural
   and intuitive interaction. we postulate that embodiment (with three
   sub-components: sense of ownership, agency, and self-location) of the
   robotic system leads to optimal perceptual transparency and increases
   task performance. however, this has not yet been investigated directly.
   we reason along four premises and present findings from the literature
   that substantiate each of them: (1) the brain can embody non-bodily
   objects (e.g., robotic hands), (2) embodiment can be elicited with
   mediated sensorimotor interaction, (3) embodiment is robust against
   inconsistencies between the robotic system and the operator's body, and
   (4) embodiment positively correlates to dexterous task performance. we
   use the predictive encoding theory as a framework to interpret and
   discuss the results reported in the literature. numerous previous
   studies have shown that it is possible to induce embodiment over a wide
   range of virtual and real extracorporeal objects (including artificial
   limbs, avatars, and android robots) through mediated sensorimotor
   interaction. also, embodiment can occur for non-human morphologies
   including for elongated arms and a tail. in accordance with the
   predictive encoding theory, none of the sensory modalities is critical
   in establishing ownership, and discrepancies in multisensory signals do
   not necessarily lead to loss of embodiment. however, large discrepancies
   in terms of multisensory synchrony or visual likeness can prohibit
   embodiment from occurring. the literature provides less extensive
   support for the link between embodiment and (dexterous) task
   performance. however, data gathered with prosthetic hands do indicate a
   positive correlation. we conclude that all four premises are supported
   by direct or indirect evidence in the literature, suggesting that
   embodiment of a remote manipulator may improve dexterous performance in
   telerobotics. this warrants further implementation testing of embodiment
   in telerobotics. we formulate a first set of guidelines to apply
   embodiment in telerobotics and identify some important research topics.}},

   indigenous australians living in remote indigenous communities (rics) is
   a complex and persistent problem. smartphones are increasingly being
   used by young indigenous adults and therefore represent a promising
   method to engage them in programs seeking to improve nutritional intake.
   objective: this study aimed to consult ric members to inform the content
   of a smartphone app that can be used to monitor and reduce
   sugar-sweetened beverage intake in rics.
   methods: the study was conducted in two phases. the formative phase
   involved a simulated grocery selection activity with think aloud
   ({''}think aloud shop{''}), a semistructured interview, a questionnaire
   outlining current smartphone and app use, and a paper prototyping
   activity. a preliminary end-user testing phase involved a think aloud
   prototype test and a semistructured interview regarding user
   satisfaction. convenience sampling was used to recruit 20 18-to
   35-year-old smartphone users for each phase from two rics in the
   northern territory, australia. thematic analysis of transcribed audio
   recordings was used to identify determinants of food choice from the
   think aloud shop; themes related to the theory of planned behavior (tpb)
   from the eating behaviors interview; and usability, comprehension, and
   satisfaction with the app from the preliminary end-user testing.
   results: smartphone use in rics is currently different to that found in
   urban environments; in particular, extremely low use of facebook,
   restricted variety of phone types, and limited internet access. findings
   regarding promoting app engagement indicate that utilizing an opt-in
   approach to social features such as leader boards and team challenges is
   essential. the inclusion of games was also shown to be important for
   satisfaction, as were the use of audio features, contextually embedded
   dissemination, and streamlined app design for comprehension in this
   target group.
   conclusions: this research provides critical insights and concrete
   recommendations for the development of lifestyle improvement apps
   targeted toward disadvantaged young adults in nonurban settings,
   specifically rics. it serves as a framework for future app development
   projects using a consultative user-centered design approach, supporting
   calls for the increased use of this strategy in app development.}},

   there arises the problem of system restructuring, under system
   functioning conditions breach because of changes in the noise-signaling
   environment or the system operating conditions. any rearrangement of the
   system's digital frequency-dependent components leads to the occurrence
   of transient process, which duration is determined by the components
   characteristics. the traditional approach to the transient process
   analysis refers to the zero initial conditions, however, the intelligent
   sensors and specialized computer systems operation as well as parameters
   adjustment as well as other system components can be performed under
   non-zero initial conditions. this implies the need for a large number of
   computations, not feasible sometimes in real time. here essential is to
   assess the duration of process' transition to readjustment process to
   provide the system operability under new conditions.
   objective. to estimate the transient process' maximum duration when
   rearrangement, to determine the possible rearrangements range and width,
   taking into account the system stability.
   method. this research carrying out improved is the indirect method of
   transient process duration estimating by the transfer function poles

   results. the effected analysis with relevant modeling and theoretical
   verification allowed obtaining relations to estimate the transient

   results we built the dependencies of transient process duration onto the

   estimating the transient process duration along the transfer function
   poles, while simplifying the irrational function expansion, that making
   possible, before the rearrangement beginning, considering the given new

   transactions. the findings of moderation analysis highlighted that users
   in the lower income group are more concerned about the performance
   characteristics of banking apps, and there are no differences across age

   documentation for task-shifted interventions, we identified 9 software
   requirements that aim to support health workers in management and
   supervision, training, good relationship with other health workers, and
   community embeddedness of the intervention. these 9 software
   requirements were used to implement a system for the provision of a
   psychosocial depression intervention with mobile android interfaces to
   structure interventions and collect data, and web interfaces for
   supervision and support of the health care workers delivering the
   intervention. the system was tested in a 2-arm pilot study with 33
   patients and 11 health workers. in all, 8 of these 11 health workers
   participated in a usability study subsequent to the pilot.
   results: the qualitative and quantitative feedback obtained with the
   system usability scale suggest that the system was deemed to have a
   usability of between ok and good. nevertheless, some participants'
   responses indicated that they felt they needed technical assistance to
   use the system. this was reinforced by answers obtained with perceived
   usefulness and ease of use questionnaires, which indicated some users
   felt that they had issues around correct use of the system and perceived
   ability to become skillful at using the system.
   conclusions: overall, these high-level requirements adequately captured
   the functionality required to enable the health workers to provide the
   intervention successfully. nevertheless, the analysis of results
   indicated that some improvements were required for the system to be
   useable in a task-shifted intervention. the most important of these were
   better access to a training environment, access for supervisors to
   metadata such as duration of sessions or exercises to identify issues,
   and a more robust and human-error-proof approach to the availability of
   patient data on the mobile devices used during the intervention.}},

  abstract  = {{global navigation satellite systems (gnsss) are generally not applicable
   for indoor navigation scenarios due to the signal absorption of building
   structures. besides, a robust and accurate positioning system for indoor
   navigation may involve high costs for local building installations and
   advanced mobile equipment. additionally, such systems-especially mobile
   frontends-are often highly tailored to a particular building and cannot
   be reused for other buildings. hence, a solution is warranted that
   requires neither a costly installation inside buildings nor particular
   mobile equipment. moreover, mobile frontends (e.g. mobile applications)
   should be usable for different buildings. we contribute an indoor
   navigation system that requires only commodity hardware components.
   users can bring their own smartphone equipped with a mobile indoor
   navigation application. this mobile indoor navigation application
   provides an import interface for models of different buildings. in turn,
   the facilities must only provide wi-fi access points and/or quick
   response (qr) codes as a minimal localization infrastructure as is often
   the case. the developed indoor navigation system exploits different
   sensors (e.g. wi-fi, {[}pseudo] compass, barometer, image recognition)
   for positioning the users and can detect the direction of (vertical)
   movement. the mobile indoor navigation application also provides
   different methods for localization (e.g. wi-fi network id, wi-fi
   trilateration, wi-fi fingerprinting, and wi-fi with weighted average).
   moreover, it can calculate routes between the current and the desired
   position of a user, and also present tracks how users move through the
   building. it supports routing through different floor levels as well.
   the designed solution provides for the flexible management of map data
   (building models, floor plan models, etc.). institutions (e.g.
   universities, public authorities) that meet the mentioned
   infrastructural requirements can easily create a model of their building
   by using floor plans annotated with the locations of wi-fi access
   points. an automatic mechanism extracts a formal graph-like model from
   the annotated floor plans. this is subsequently imported to the mobile
   indoor navigation application. the developed mobile indoor navigation
   application works as an interpreter of runtime models (cf. vaupel
   {[}1]), and particularly interprets building models. thus, the
   participating institutions need no programming skills to adapt the
   indoor navigation system for their buildings. building plans (e.g.
   scanned floor plans) can be annotated with open-source standard
   software.
   the designed mobile navigation application was evaluated using a case
   study. two campus buildings (with more than 500 rooms) were modeled and
   the different localization methods were tested. the evaluation
   demonstrates the applicability and usefulness of both the modeling
   approach of buildings and the mobile navigation application itself.}},

   applications (apps) improve diabetes-related outcomes. we conducted a
   rapid evidence review to examine features, clinical efficacy, and

   adults.
   ovid/medline and the cochrane database of systematic reviews were
   searched for systematic reviews and technology assessments. reference
   lists of relevant systematic reviews were examined for primary studies.
   additional searches for primary studies were conducted online, through
   ovid/medline, embase, cinahl, and studies were evaluated for eligibility
   based on predetermined criteria, data were extracted, study quality was
   assessed using a risk of bias tool, information on app features was
   collected, and app usability was assessed. results are summarized
   qualitatively.
   fifteen articles evaluating 11 apps were identified: six apps for type 1
   and five apps for type 2 diabetes. common features of apps included
   setting reminders and tracking blood glucose and hemoglobin a1c (hba1c),
   medication use, physical activity, and weight. compared with controls,
   use of eight apps, when paired with support from a healthcare provider
   or study staff, improved at least one outcome, most often hba1c.
   patients did not experience improvements in quality of life, blood
   pressure, or weight, regardless of app used or type of diabetes. study
   quality was variable. of the eight apps available for usability testing,
   two were scored ``acceptable,{''} three were ``marginal,{''} and three
   were ``not acceptable.{''}
   limited evidence suggests that use of some commercially available apps,
   when combined with additional support from a healthcare provider or
   study staff, may improve some short-term diabetes-related outcomes. the
   impact of these apps on longer-term outcomes is unclear. more rigorous
   and longer-term studies of apps are needed.

   where patients are lost between diagnosis, laboratory evaluation,
   treatment initiation, and retention in hiv care, is a well- described
   challenge. growing access to internet-enabled mobile phones has led to
   an interest in using the technology to improve patient engagement with
   health care.
   objective: the objectives of this trial were: (1) to assess whether a
   mobile phone-enabled app could provide hiv patients with laboratory test
   results, (2) to better understand the implementation of such an
   intervention, and (3) to determine app effectiveness in improving
   linkage to hiv care after diagnosis. methods: we developed and tested an
   app through a randomized controlled trial carried out in several primary
   health care facilities in johannesburg. newly diagnosed hiv-positive
   patients were screened, recruited, and randomized into the trial as they
   were giving a blood sample for initial cd4 staging. trial eligibility
   included ownership of a phone compatible with the app and access to the
   internet. trial participants were followed for a minimum of eight months
   to determine linkage to hiv care indicated by an hiv-related laboratory
   test result.
   results: the trial outcome results are being prepared for publication,
   but here we describe the significant operational and technological
   lessons provided by the implementation. android was identified as the
   most suitable operating system for the app, due to android functionality
   and communication characteristics. android also had the most significant
   market share of all smartphone operating systems in south africa. the
   app was successfully developed with laboratory results sent to personal
   smartphones. however, given the trial requirements and the app itself,
   only 10\% of screened hiv patients successfully enrolled. we report on
   issues such as patient eligibility, app testing in a dynamic phone
   market, software installation and compatibility, safe identification of
   patients, linkage of laboratory results to patients lacking unique
   identifiers, and present lessons and potential solutions.
   conclusions: the implementation challenges and lessons of this trial may
   assist future similar mhealth interventions to avoid some of the
   pitfalls. ensuring sufficient expertise and understanding of the
   programmatic needs by the software developer, as well as in the
   implementation team, with adequate and rapid piloting within the target
   groups, could have led to better trial recruitment. however, the
   majority of screened patients were interested in the study, and the app
   was installed successfully in patients with suitable smartphones,
   suggesting that this may be a way to engage patients with their health
   care data in future.}},

  abstract       = {{background: breast cancer is an invalidating disease and its treatment
   can bring serious side effects that have a physical and psychological
   impact. specifically, cancer treatment generally has a strong impact on
   cognitive function. in recent years, new technologies and ehealth have
   had a growing influence on health care and innovative mobile apps can be
   useful tools to deliver cognitive exercise in the patient's home.
   objective: this systematic review gives an overview of the
   state-of-the-art mobile apps aimed at training cognitive functions to
   better understand whether these apps could be useful tools to counteract
   cognitive impairment in breast cancer patients.
   methods: we searched in a systematic way all the full-text articles from
   the pubmed and embase databases.
   results: we found eleven studies using mobile apps to deliver cognitive
   training. they included a total of 819 participants. app and study
   characteristics are presented and discussed, including cognitive domains
   trained (attention, problem solving, memory, cognitive control,
   executive function, visuospatial function, and language). none of the
   apps were specifically developed for breast cancer patients. they were
   generally developed for a specific clinical population. only 2 apps deal
   with more than 1 cognitive domain, and only 3 studies focus on the
   efficacy of the app training intervention.
   conclusions: these results highlight the lack of empirical evidence on
   the efficacy of currently available apps to train cognitive function.
   cognitive domains are not well defined across studies. it is noteworthy
   that no apps are specifically developed for cancer patients, and their
   applicability to breast cancer should not be taken for granted. future
   studies should test the feasibility, usability, and effectiveness of
   available cognitive training apps in women with breast cancer. due to
   the complexity and multidimensionality of cognitive difficulties in this
   cancer population, it may be useful to design, develop, and implement an
   ad hoc app targeting cognitive impairment in breast cancer patients.}},

   subsequently, this study tested the feasibility and appropriateness of
   experience sampling method (esm), an ecological momentary assessment, on
   typically developing children aged between five and seven years.
   methods: ten children (five boys and five girls) carried an android (c)
   device with a pre-installed esm survey exploring their everyday life and
   their perceived internal experiences. children were asked to respond to
   the survey eight times daily, at random times generated by the device,
   for seven days.
   results: an acceptable signal response rate (47.6 +/- 18.9\%) and short
   average time required for survey completion (83 +/- 49 seconds)
   supported the feasibility of the esm for use in research with children
   aged between five and seven years. children reported the questions were
   straightforward and survey completion interfered very little with
   everyday activities, supporting appropriateness of the method. through

   commonplace, but the algorithms used by these devices to score sleep are
   not open source, and the raw sensor data is rarely accessible for
   external use. as a result, these devices are limited in their usefulness
   for clinical and research applications, despite holding much promise. we
   used a mobile application of our own creation to collect raw
   acceleration data and heart rate from the apple watch worn by
   participants undergoing polysomnography, as well as during the
   ambulatory period preceding in lab testing. using this data, we compared
   the contributions of multiple features (motion, local standard deviation
   in heart rate, and ``clock proxy{''}) to performance across several
   classifiers. best performance was achieved using neural nets, though the
   differences across classifiers were generally small. for sleep-wake
   classification, our method scored 90\% of epochs correctly, with 59.6\%
   of true wake epochs (specificity) and 93\% of true sleep epochs
   (sensitivity) scored correctly. accuracy for differentiating wake, nrem
   sleep, and rem sleep was approximately 72\% when all features were used.
   we generalized our results by testing the models trained on apple watch
   data using data from the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (mesa),
   and found that we were able to predict sleep with performance comparable
   to testing on our own dataset. this study demonstrates, for the first
   time, the ability to analyze raw acceleration and heart rate data from a
   ubiquitous wearable device with accepted, disclosed mathematical methods
   to improve accuracy of sleep and sleep stage prediction.
   statement of significance
   use of consumer sleep trackers is widespread, but because the type of
   data returned from the devices is often proprietary (e.g. ``fitbit
   steps{''}) and the algorithms are typically trade secret, most are not
   used by the clinical and research communities. we wrote our own code to
   directly access the accelerometer on the apple watch. we then recorded
   raw acceleration, along with heart rate data as measured via
   photoplethysmography in the apple watch, during the night while subjects
   underwent the gold standard for sleep tracking, polysomnography. we
   compared the output of multiple classification algorithms to ground
   truth polysomnography to determine best performance. this sets the stage
   for greater transparency in the use of wearables to assess sleep on a
   large scale.}},

  abstract       = {{background: stroke, as a leading cause of death around the globe, has
   become a heavy burden on our society. studies show that stroke can be
   predicted and prevented if a person's blood pressure (bp) status is
   appropriately monitored via an ambulatory blood pressure monitor (abpm)
   system. however, currently there exists no efficient and user-friendly
   abpm system to provide early warning for stroke risk in real-time.
   moreover, most existing abpm devices measure bp during the deflation of
   the cuff, which fails to reflect blood pressure accurately.
   objective: in this study, we sought to develop a new abpm mobile health
   (mhealth) system that was capable of monitoring blood pressure during
   inflation and could detect early stroke-risk signals in real-time.
   methods: we designed an abpm mhealth system that is based on mobile
   network infrastructure and mobile apps. the proposed system contains two
   major parts: a new abpm device in which an inflation-type bp measurement
   algorithm is embedded, and an abnormal blood pressure data analysis
   algorithm for stroke-risk prediction services at our health data service
   center. for evaluation, the abpm device was first tested using simulated
   signals and compared with the gold standard of a mercury
   sphygmomanometer. then, the performance of our proposed mhealth system
   was evaluated in an observational study.
   results: the results are presented in two main parts: the device test
   and the longitudinal observational studies of the presented system. the
   average measurement error of the new abpm device with the inflation-type
   algorithm was less than 0.55 mmhg compared to a reference device using
   simulated signals moreover, the results of correlation coefficients and
   agreement analyses show that there is a strong linear correlation
   between our device and the standard mercury sphygmomanometer. in the
   case of the system observational study, we collected a data set with 88
   features, including real-time data, user information, and user records.
   our abnormal blood pressure data analysis algorithm achieved the best
   performance, with an area under the curve of 0.904 for the low risk
   level, 0.756 for the caution risk level, and 0.912 for the high-risk
   level. our system enables a patient to be aware of their risk in
   real-time, which improves medication adherence with risk
   self-management.
   conclusions: to our knowledge, this device is the first abpm device that
   measures blood pressure during the inflation process and has obtained a
   government medical license. device tests and longitudinal observational
   studies were conducted in peking university hospitals, and they showed
   the device's high accuracy for bp measurements, its efficiency in
   detecting early signs of stroke, and its efficiency at providing an
   early warning for stroke risk.}},

   of authentication, passwords still remain the de-facto authentication
   standard in use today. though password managers can ameliorate password
   fatigue, the vast majority of password managers require the user to
   choose and maintain a strong master password while offering little to no
   recourse in the event that the master password is compromised. the
   wide-application of cloud-based password managers congregate passwords
   in an encrypted database, which becomes an attractive target for
   attackers and also represents a single point of failure. in this paper,
   we propose amnesia, a bilateral generative password manager that
   requires both the knowledge of the master password and the possession of
   the user's smartphone to generate website passwords for the user. our
   generative password manager is not vulnerable to the password database
   leakage, since it generates the requested password on demand using both
   the master password and the secret information on the smartphone. an
   attacker wishing to steal the user's website passwords has to compromise
   both the user's smartphone and the master password. amnesia also has
   strong recovery capability when either the master password is
   compromised or the smartphone is lost/stolen. by using an amnesia
   server, a user can have the access to the password manager on multiple
   computers without installing any software on those computers. we
   implemented an amnesia system prototype using android and cherrypy web
   framework and evaluated it in terms of security, usability, and
   overhead. a user study of 31 testers shows that amnesia increases
   password security while maintaining reasonable user convenience.}},

   unquestionable potential as a learning method, their effectiveness has
   not been fully proven, and the positive impacts and outcomes of mobile
   learning games with respect to learning have yet to be investigated.
   aim. the study aimed at capturing the cognitive learning outcomes and

   positive and negative cognitive learning effects of using mobile
   learning game in comparison with the textbook learning process.
   methodology. this article presents a comparative study conducted on a
   group of 160 freshman students majoring in management and finance. the
   participants of the study, divided into subgroups, were taught using
   either textbook-based learning or a mobile learning game. three tests
   were applied to measure their performance: a pre-test at the beginning

   after the learning process and the second 2-3 weeks after the initial
   learning.
   results and recommendations. mlg have been proven to create many
   positive effect for learning. it is as effective in transferring factual
   knowledge as textbook learning, when measured directly after the
   learning process. in longer term, the effects are blurred because the
   affective effects interfere with the measurement.}},

   a global prevalence of 2-3\%. ocd can have an enormous impact on the
   lives of those with the disorder, with some studies suggesting suicidal
   ideation is present in over 50\% of individuals with ocd, and other data
   showing a significant number of individuals attempt suicide. it is
   therefore important that individuals with ocd receive the best possible
   treatment. a greater understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of
   neuropsychiatric disorders among professionals and future clinicians can
   lead to improved treatment. however, data suggests that many students
   and clinicians experience ``neurophobia{''}, a lack of knowledge or
   confidence in cases involving the nervous system. in addition, research
   suggests that the relationship many students have with neurological
   conditions deteriorates over time, and can persist into practice.
   if individuals living with conditions such as ocd are to receive the
   best possible treatment, it is crucial that those administering care are
   equipped with a thorough understanding of such disorders. while research
   has shown that the use of interactive 3d models can improve anatomy
   education and more specifically neurology education, the efficacy of
   using of such models to engage with neuropsychiatric conditions,
   specifically ocd, has not been assessed. this study seeks to address
   this gap.
   in this study an interactive application for android devices was
   designed using standardised software engineering methods in order to
   improve neuropsychiatry literacy by empowering self-pace learning
   through interactive 3d visualisations and animations of the neural
   circuitry involved in ocd. a pilot test and a usability assessment were
   conducted among five postgraduate life science students. findings
   relating to user experience were promising, and pre-test vs. post-test
   evaluation suggested encouraging outcomes regarding the effectiveness of
   the application in improving the knowledge and understanding of ocd. in
   short, this study suggests that interactive 3d visualisations can
   improve neuropsychiatry education. for this reason, more efforts should
   be made to construct similar applications in order to ensure patients

   introduces four mhealth evaluation models and tools and describes the

  abstract             = {{background: anxiety and mood disorders are the most common mental
   illnesses, peaking during adolescence and affecting approximately 25\%
   of canadians aged 14-17 years. if not successfully treated at this age,
   they often persist into adulthood, exerting a great social and economic
   toll. given the long-term impact, finding ways to increase the success
   and cost-effectiveness of mental health care is a pressing need.
   cognitive behavior therapy (cbt) is an evidence-based treatment for mood
   and anxiety disorders throughout the lifespan. mental health
   technologies can be used to make such treatments more successful by
   delivering them in a format that increases utilization. young people
   embrace technologies, and many want to actively manage their mental
   health. mobile software apps have the potential to improve youth
   adherence to cbt and, in turn, improve outcomes of treatment.
   objective: the purpose of this project is to improve homework adherence
   in cbt for youth anxiety and/or depression. the objectives are to (1)
   design and optimize the usability of a mobile app for delivering the
   homework component of cbt for youth with anxiety and/or depression, (2)
   assess the app's impact on homework completion, and (3) implement the
   app in cbt programs. we hypothesize that homework adherence will be
   greater in the app group than in the no-app group.
   methods: phase 1: exploratory interviews will be conducted with
   adolescents and therapists familiar with cbt to obtain views and
   perspectives on the requirements and features of a usable app and the
   challenges involved in implementation. the information obtained will
   guide the design of a prototype. the prototype will be optimized via
   think-aloud procedures involving an iterative process of evaluation,
   modification, and re-evaluation, culminating in a fully functional
   version of the prototype that is ready for optimization in a clinical
   context. phase 2: a usability study will be conducted to optimize the
   prototype in the context of treatment at clinics that provide cbt
   treatment for youth with anxiety and/or depression. this phase will
   result in a usable app that is ready to be tested for its effectiveness
   in increasing homework adherence. phase 3: a pragmatic clinical trial
   will be conducted at several clinics to evaluate the impact of the app
   on homework adherence. participants in the app group are expected to
   show greater homework completion than those in the no-app group.
   results: phase 3 will be completed by september 2019.
   conclusions: the app will be a unique adjunct to treatment for
   adolescents in cbt, focusing on both anxiety and depression, developed
   in partnership with end users at every stage from design to
   implementation, customizable for different cognitive profiles, and
   designed with depression symptom tracking measures for youth made
   interoperable with electronic medical records.}},

   an over-sensitive zoom feature. three categories of error were

   recommendations are offered, such as using more appropriate `signage'

   the quality of the data collected by volunteers was comparable to the

  abstract  = {{introduction: there are many available applications for smartphones to
   measure heart rate (hr) based on a finger pulse wave, without any
   additional devices. an important feature of the application should be
   the possibility to detect arrhythmia, especially atrial fibrillation
   (af). the purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of hr
   measurement applications, available for smartphones, in terms of the
   reliability of the measurements and the possibilities for arrhythmia
   detection.
   material/methods : from the free applications available on smartphones
   with the ios operating system we selected all (n=16), which offer hr
   measurement and a simultaneous graphical pulse wave recording. the hr
   was examined in 15 healthy volunteers with a sinus rhythm confirmed in
   ecg. the next step was to evaluate the reliability of hr measurement in
   15 patients with af.
   results: the average difference in the hr was 6\% (0.6\%-33\%), while a
   difference below 5\% was observed in 11 applications. according to our
   study, the most reliable applications to measure hr in patients with
   sinus rhythm was instant heart rate by azumio company. five most
   reliable applications have been selected to test in patients with af. we
   have chosen this application according to the most reliable hr
   measurement (<5\%), best graphic pulse wave recording and the ability to
   view the recording at the end of the measurement. only 1 of 5
   applications - heart rate from bump company - had >95\% hr compatibility
   with ecg (the measurement difference was 0.88 \%).
   conclusions: the majority of the free applications, available for
   smartphones, are able to measure hr precisely in patients with sinus
   rhythm, while in patients with af, the exact measurement is
   significantly impeded by hr deficits. only one out of 16 applications
   was able to measure hr in a patient with af. none of the available

   methods: an ios application was designed to collect medication use in
   formation relevant for research from volunteer astronaut crewmembers:
   medication name, dose, dosing frequency, indication, perceived efficacy,
   and side effects. leveraging the limited medication choices aboard
   allowed a streamlined questionnaire. there were 24 subjects approved for
   participation.
   results: six crewmembers completed flight a collection and five
   completed ground data collection before nasa's early study
   discontinuation. there were 5766 medication use entries, averaging 20.6
   +/- 8.4 entries per subject per flight week. types of medications and
   their indications were similar to previous reports, with sleep
   disturbances and muscle/joint pain as primary drivers. two subjects

   unanticipated ways: to note drug tolerance testing or medication holiday

   discussion: the volume of data collected (20.6 +/- 8.4 entries per

   improving the delivery of high-quality health care services. yet, there
   has been little research so far applying mhealth technologies in the
   context of delivering stroke care in resource-limited rural regions.
   objective: this study aimed to introduce the design and development of
   an mhealth system targeting primary health care providers and to
   ascertain its feasibility in supporting the delivery of a
   system-integrated technology-enabled model of care (sinema) service for
   strengthening secondary prevention of stroke in rural china.
   methods: the sinema mhealth system was designed by a multidisciplinary
   team comprising public health researchers, neurologists, and information
   and communication technology experts. the iterative co-design and
   development of the mhealth system involved the following 5 steps: (1)
   assessing the needs of relevant end users through in-depth interviews of
   stakeholders, (2) designing the functional modules and evidence-based
   care content, (3) designing and building the system and user interface,
   (4) improving and enhancing the system through a 3-month pilot test in 4
   villages, and (5) finalizing the system and deploying it in field trial,
   and finally, evaluating its feasibility through a survey of the dominant
   user group.
   results: from the in-depth interviews of 49 relevant stakeholders, we
   found that village doctors had limited capacity in caring for
   village-dwelling stroke patients in rural areas. primary health care
   workers demonstrated real needs in receiving appropriate training and
   support from the mhealth system as well as great interests in using the
   mhealth technologies and tools. using these findings, we designed a
   multifaceted mhealth system with 7 functional modules by following the
   iterative user-centered design and software development approach. the
   mhealth system, aimed at 3 different types of users (village doctors,
   town physicians, and county managers), was developed and utilized in a
   cluster-randomized controlled trial by 25 village doctors in a
   resource-limited county in rural china to manage 637 stroke patients
   between july 2017 and july 2018. in the end, a survey on the usability
   and functions of the mhealth system among village doctors (the dominant
   group of users, response rate=96\%, 24/25) revealed that most of them
   were satisfied with the essential functions provided (71\%) and were
   keen to continue using it (92\%) after the study.
   conclusions: the mhealth system was feasible for assisting primary
   health care providers in rural china in delivering the sinema service on
   the secondary prevention of stroke. further research and initiatives in
   scaling up the sinema approach and this mhealth system to other
   resource-limited regions in china and beyond will likely enhance the
   quality and accessibility of essential secondary prevention among stroke
   patients.}},

   performance bounds are theoretically proved. we have implemented
   smartphoto in a testbed using android based smartphones, and proposed

   scenario recognition is essential for seamless indoor and outdoor
   localization and robust positioning in complex environments. with the
   popularity of multi-constellation smartphones, scenario recognition
   based on smartphone global navigation satellite system (gnss)
   measurements becomes desirable. in this paper, we divide the complex
   environments into four categories (deep indoor, shallow indoor,
   semi-outdoor and open outdoor) and conduct research work in two areas.
   firstly, we analyze in detail the influence of multi-constellation
   satellite signals on scenario recognition performance based on a hidden
   markov model (hmm) algorithm. the experimental results show that the
   scenario recognition accuracy is improved significantly with the
   increase of the number of constellations received by smartphones.
   secondly, in order to solve the description degradation of the
   traditional model caused by scenario transitions and environmental
   changes around the scenario, we propose a new scenario recognition
   method based on recurrent neural network (rnn). considering the
   computational complexity and the availability of feature values, we
   utilize the position-independent features as the input of the rnn model,
   and then evaluate the performance of the model using test sets from the
   new places. the results indicate that our proposed algorithm has high
   recognition accuracy in both isolated scenarios and transition regions,
   with the overall accuracy of 98.65\%. especially in the scenario
   transitions, the recognition accuracy reaches 90.94\% and in the three
   times of correct recognition for scenario transitions (four times in
   total), the maximum transition delay is only 3 s. (c) 2019 elsevier ltd.

  abstract             = {{smartphone indoor localization has attracted considerable attention over
   the past decade because of the considerable business potential in terms
   of indoor navigation and location-based services. in particular, wi-fi
   rss (received signal strength) fingerprinting for indoor localization
   has received significant attention in the industry, for its advantage of
   freely using off-the-shelf aps (access points). however, rss measured by
   heterogeneous mobile devices is generally biased due to the variety of
   embedded hardware, leading to a systematical mismatch between online
   measures and the pre-established radio maps. additionally, the
   fingerprinting method based on a single rss measurement usually suffers
   from signal fluctuations due to environmental changes or human body
   blockage, leading to possible large localization errors. in this
   context, this study proposes a space-constrained pairwise signal
   strength differences (pssd) strategy to improve wi-fi fingerprinting
   reliability, and mitigate the effect of hardware bias of different
   smartphone devices on positioning accuracy without requiring a
   calibration process. with the efforts of these two aspects, the proposed
   solution enhances the usability of wi-fi fingerprint positioning. the
   pssd approach consists of two critical operations in constructing
   particular fingerprints. first, we construct the signal strength
   difference (ssd) radio map of the area of interest, which uses the rss
   differences between aps to minimize the device-dependent effect. then,
   the pairwise rss fingerprints are constructed by leveraging the
   time-series rss measurements and potential spatial topology of
   pedestrian locations of these measurement epochs, and consequently
   reducing possible large positioning errors. to verify the proposed pssd
   method, we carry out extensive experiments with various android
   smartphones in a campus building. in the case of heterogeneous devices,
   the experimental results demonstrate that pssd fingerprinting achieves a
   mean error approximate to 20\% less than conventional rss
   fingerprinting. in addition, pssd fingerprinting achieves a
   90-percentile accuracy of no greater than 5.5 m across the tested
   heterogeneous smartphones}},

   specifically for men who have sex with men (msm). we will call these
   mobile phone apps msm apps for simplicity. at present, the
   characteristics and quality and purpose of these msm apps are unclear.
   objective: the aim of this study was to objectively and comprehensively
   evaluate the characteristics and quality of the msm apps to assess
   whether they disseminated health information among the msm in china.
   methods: we searched 2 dominant mobile phone app stores (apple store and
   android market) to obtain msm apps using the keywords msm, gay, lesbian,
   gay, bisexual, and transgender (lgbt),. apps were excluded if they did
   not have a chinese language interface or if their target population was
   not msm. basic information about the eligible apps for this study, such
   as app name, app store category, and date of last update was gathered
   from the specified app stores. the quality of apps was rated by 2
   independent raters using mobile app rating scale (mars). the intraclass
   correlation coefficient (icc) between raters was computed as a measure
   for interrater reliability of the mars. all analyses were conducted
   using spss version 20.0 (spss inc).
   results: a total of 575 apps were reviewed between september 15, 2018
   and september 30, 2018, out of which, 532 apps were excluded. finally,
   43 apps were included. of the 43 apps, 16 were from the apple store, 10
   were from android market, and 17 were available in both app stores. in
   addition, 39 out of 43 apps were for social and sexual networking,
   whereas 10 contained sexual health information, for example,
   hiv/sexually transmitted diseases knowledge, hiv test, and condom use.
   the average rating was 4 stars. the number of downloads for 21 apps
   exceeded 10,000. a total of 31 apps had acceptable quality (as defined
   by a mars score of >3), with functionality as the highest scoring
   domain, followed by information quality, esthetics, and engagement.
   interrater reliability was excellent for the overall mean app quality
   scores (icc=.946; 95\% ci 0.904-0.970) and the subjective quality scores
   (icc=.910; 95\% ci 0.841-0.950).
   conclusions: by reviewing the available apps, we found that msm apps are
   popular. the majority of msm apps are for dating, whereas few of them
   contain hiv prevention and health information. the overall quality of
   the apps is acceptable. the utilization of mobile phone technologies is
   a promising way for delivering hiv prevention messages to msm. we
   recommend that researchers and app developers should work together to
   disseminate health information for msm via mobile technologies.}},

   paper proposes a mechanism of decoupling wireless resource allocation
   from mobile terminal by mapping different ip flows to different virtual
   wireless cards, which makes it possible to support integrated management
   in wired and wireless network. by extending sdn framework to support
   virtual network interface, the traditional controller has a global view
   of network and calculates the ip stream policy for the mobile terminal
   with multiple virtual network interface. local agent and flow manager
   are extended on mobile terminal to maintain the state of virtual

   patients because of discontinued standard treatments and reductions in
   medication adherence. motivated by the need for better pain management
   in discharged patients, we developed a mobile phone app (pain guard) to
   provide continuous treatment information and feedback to discharged
   cancer patients suffering from pain.
   objective: the aim was to design, construct, and test the pain guard app
   in patients managing cancer pain, evaluate the total remission rate of
   pain and the improvement in quality of life (qol) to improve pain
   management for cancer pain patients, and assess patient acceptance of
   the app.
   methods: this randomized controlled double-arm study involved 58
   patients with cancer pain symptoms. participants were randomly assigned
   to a group receiving care through the pain guard app (n=31) or to a
   control group (n=27) who received only traditional pharmaceutical care.
   in a pretest, participants were rated using a baseline cancer pain
   assessment and qol evaluation. during treatment, the consumption levels
   of analgesic drugs were recorded every week. after a 4-week study
   period, another round of cancer pain assessment and qol evaluation was
   conducted. the system's usability, feasibility, app compliance, and
   satisfaction were also assessed. our primary outcome was remission rate
   of pain, and secondary outcomes were medication adherence, improvements
   in qol, frequency of breakthrough cancer pain (btcp), incidence of
   adverse reactions, and satisfaction of patients.
   results: all participants (n=58) successfully completed the study. there
   were no significant differences in baseline pain scores or baseline qol
   scores between groups. at the end of the study, the rate of pain
   remission in the trial group was significantly higher than that in the
   control group (p<.001). the frequency of btcp in the app group was
   considerably lower than that in the control group (p<.001). the rate of
   medication adherence in the trial group was considerably higher than
   that in the control group (p<.001). improvements in global qol scores in
   the trial group were also significantly higher than those in the control
   group (p<.001). the incidence of adverse reactions in the trial group
   (7/31) was lower than that in the control group (12/27), especially
   constipation, with significant differences (p=.01). the 31 participants
   in the trial group completed a satisfaction survey regarding pain guard:
   23 (74\%) indicated that they were satisfied with receiving
   pharmaceutical care by pain guard, 5 (16\%) indicated that they were
   somewhat satisfied, 2 (6\%) indicated neutral feelings, and 1 (3\%)
   indicated that they were somewhat dissatisfied; no participants
   indicated that they were very dissatisfied.
   conclusions: pain guard was effective for the management of pain in
   discharged patients with cancer pain, and its operability was effective
   and easily accepted by patients.}},

   approaches, e.g., maui and clonecloud, have been proposed, aiming to
   offload parts of the mobile application execution to the cloud. to
   achieve a good performance by using these approaches, they particularly
   focus on the application partitioning problem, i.e., to decide which
   parts of an application should be offloaded to the cloud and which parts
   should be executed on mobile devices such that the execution cost is
   minimized. most works on this problem assume that the offloading cost of
   each part of the application remains the same as the application is
   running. unfortunately, this assumption does not hold in dynamic mobile
   cloud environments, where the device and network connection status may
   fluctuate, and thus affects the offloading cost. with the varying
   offloading cost, the one time partitioning of the application may yield
   significant performance degradations. in this paper, we study
   application repartitioning problem which considers updating the
   partition periodically during the course of application execution. we
   first propose a framework for run time application repartitioning in
   dynamic mobile cloud environments. based on this framework, we take the
   dynamic network connection to clouds as a case study, and design an
   online solution, foreseer, to solve the mobile cloud application
   repartitioning problem. we evaluate our solution based on real world
   data traces that are collected in a campus wifi hotspot testbed. the
   result shows that our method can achieve significantly shorter
   completion time over previous approaches.}},

   many small and medium-sized companies can hardly test the app adequately

   how such systems have been utilized to facilitate patient work.
   objective: this study aimed to characterize the different tasks and
   contexts in which context-aware systems for patient work were used as
   well as to assess any existing evidence about the impact of such systems
   on health-related process or outcome measures.
   methods: a total of 6 databases (medline, embase, cinahl, acm digital,
   web of science, and scopus) were scanned using a predefined search
   strategy. studies were included in the review if they focused on
   patients with chronic conditions, involved the use of a context-aware
   system to support patients' health-related activities, and reported the
   evaluation of the systems by the users. studies were screened by
   independent reviewers, and a narrative synthesis of included studies was
   conducted.
   results: the database search retrieved 1478 citations; 6 papers were
   included, all published from 2009 onwards. the majority of the papers
   were quasi-experimental and involved pilot and usability testing with a
   small number of users; there were no randomized controlled trials (rcts)

   studies, context was captured using sensors or self-reports, sometimes
   involving both. most studies used a combination of sensor technology and
   mobile apps to deliver personalized feedback. a total of 3 studies
   examined the impact of interventions on health-related measures, showing
   positive results.
   conclusions: the use of context-aware systems to support patient work is

  abstract             = {{it is assumed in the pi-calculus that communication channels are always
   noiseless. but it is usually not the case in the mobile systems that
   developers are faced with in the real life. in this paper, we introduce
   an extension of pi, called pi(n), in which noisy channels may be
   present. a probabilistic transitional semantics of pi(n) is given. the
   notions of approximate (strong) bisimilarity and equivalence between
   agents in pi(n) are proposed, and various algebraic laws for them are
   established. in particular, we introduce the notion of stratified
   bisimulation which is suited to describe behavior equivalence between
   infinite probabilistic processes. some useful techniques for reasoning
   about approximate bisimilarity and equivalence are developed. we also
   introduce a notion of reliability in order to compare different
   behaviors of an agent in pi and pi(n). it is shown that reliability is
   preserved by the basic combinators in pi. a link between reliability and
   bisimulation is given. this provides us with a uniform framework in
   which we can reason about both correctness properties and reliability of
   mobile systems. also, a potential way of combing value-passing process
   algebras and shannon's information theory is pointed out.}},

  abstract       = {{introduction: epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized
   by recurrent spontaneous seizures. over 70\% epilepsy patients can live
   normally if their seizures can be controlled. for this, many factors
   should be tracked and managed, but doing so is hard because of
   individual differences. there are mobile applications to help track
   these factors; however, no application covers crucial factors
   comprehensively, and they are complicated to use. therefore, this study
   aimed to develop a mobile epilepsy management application covering
   crucial factors comprehensively in a user-friendly way. we evaluated the
   pilot version with a usability and satisfaction survey and an interview.
   methods: we established a task force comprising professionals from
   various fields who participated in all processes of this research.
   existing service analysis and professional interviews were conducted to
   draw a function list. user interface and graphic user interface were
   designed under the supervision of the task force. after developing the
   application's pilot version, usability and satisfaction of the
   application were evaluated with eight patients and caregivers through
   scenario-based usability test, satisfaction survey, and interview.
   results: all existing mobile epilepsy management applications provide
   seizure and medication diary functions. we decided to provide six main
   functions: seizure diary, medication reminder, appointments, outpatient
   survey, education materials, and personal dashboard (my epilepsy). we
   also integrated the application with the hospital's electronic health
   record system. to simplify usability, frequently used and relatively
   important functions are located in the main page as ``seizure
   recording{''} and ``medication diary.{''} additionally, when designing
   graphics, art therapy was used to enhance psychological stability. for
   evaluation, eight participants were recruited. in scenario-based tasks,
   among 10 tasks, all participants completed six tasks. however, only
   37.5\% participants could record seizures in detail. system usability
   scale score was 84.5 points, indicating that the system was
   satisfactory.
   conclusion: this study confirmed that patients' satisfaction of this
   application were high. additionally, it helped them record their
   seizures accurately, which is very useful for seizure trend analysis,
   discovering seizure trigger factors, and ensuring efficient management
   of epilepsy. through integration with the electronic health record,
   patient medical information could be utilized to guide physicians'
   decision-making for setting future medical treatment plan and could
   contribute greatly to the overall management of epilepsy.}},

   paper describes and applies a dgnss-correction projection method to a

   calculated using the elevation and azimuth angle provided in the
   position-related output of android's locationmanager, and this is
   transformed to earth-centered, earth-fixed coordinates for use. to
   achieve position-domain correction for satellite systems other than gps,

   used to construct an observation matrix suitable for multiple
   constellations. the results of static and dynamic tests show that the
   standalone gnss accuracy is improved by about 30\%-60\%, thereby
   reducing the existing error of 3-4 m to just 1 m. the proposed algorithm
   enables the position error to be directly corrected via software,

   increasing. appliances like mobile phones, pda's and navigation systems
   contain more and more functionality and smaller microelectronic
   components. dropping an appliance during its lifespan is very common and
   the product is required to survive this. the drop however, generates
   significant forces and vibrations on the internal assembly of the
   product. the performance of a microelectronic component under drop
   conditions has thus become an important reliability parameter.
   assessing the solder interconnect quality by means of drop impact
   testing, as standardized by e.g. jedec, during normal production
   requires considerable amounts of time and effort. besides this, the
   repeatability of the drop impact test is low and introduces elaborate
   and time-consuming analysis of the results after testing.
   already many researchers have investigated new test techniques capable
   of replacing the drop impact test. in the cbp test the solder bump is
   pulled in vertical direction from the die using a small pair of jaws. in
   this test, by varying the pull speed several different strain rates can
   be applied to the solder bump.
   in our research a correlation between the drop impact test and cold bump
   pull test is investigated. this can be divided into three parts. first
   by investigating the cold bump pull test apparatus for uncontrolled
   parameters that might introduce a bias or spread in the results.
   secondly by means of modeling the cold bump pull test to investigate
   solder bump deformation and solder bump loading during pull off. finally
   in a comparison the differences and similarities between the two tests
   are briefly discussed and some observations concerning the solder joint
   performance are presented. (c) 2009 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.}},

   area faces a strong limitation: the slow pace at which the automotive
   industry is making cars ``smarter{''}. on the contrary, the smartphone
   industry is advancing quickly. existing smartphones are endowed with
   multiple wireless interfaces and high computational power, being able to
   perform a wide variety of tasks. by combining smartphones with existing
   vehicles through an appropriate interface we are able to move closer to
   the smart vehicle paradigm, offering the user new functionalities and
   services when driving. in this paper we propose an android-based
   application that monitors the vehicle through an on board diagnostics
   (obd-ii) interface, being able to detect accidents. our proposed
   application estimates the g force experienced by the passengers in case
   of a frontal collision, which is used together with airbag triggers to
   detect accidents. the application reacts to positive detection by
   sending details about the accident through either e-mail or sms to
   pre-defined destinations, immediately followed by an automatic phone
   call to the emergency services. experimental results using a real
   vehicle show that the application is able to react to accident events in
   less than 3 seconds, a very low time, validating the feasibility of
   smartphone based solutions for improving safety on the road.}},

   there is the possibility of learning by teleconferencing, there is the
   possibility of learning by using video tutorials or audio tutorials in
   which are presented the programming modes of the teachers or the

   certain people, and each person acquires a certain way of learning
   according to their capabilities and according to their experience in
   programming or in the language in which they want to learn new things.
   also cloud storage has become very important and more applications keep
   memory in centralized cloud-oriented servers. the problem with these
   systems is the security management. for m-learning systems, the security
   should be managed both at the application level and at the communication
   level. thus, the channel on which the information between the mobile
   application and the server where the data is stored and centralized are
   changed, should be secure. and the communication between the two
   entities must be accomplished without the risk that a third party
   intervenes on this channel and modifies the interchanged data between
   the two entities. within this material are studied and analyzed the
   methods of increasing the security of mobile applications used in the
   educational environment. increasing security is done by testing both the
   applications and the services provided by the server. for mobile
   applications made in the educational environment, whitebox testing and

   the aim of this study was to evaluate the validity and usability of a
   mobile phone-based application for community-based surveillance of
   traumatic dental injuries. materials and methods a mobile phone-based
   application, dental trauma tracker (dtt), was developed. this system
   involves a mobile application for general users to report tdis and a web

   evaluation used mixed methods and was conducted in three phases: (a)
   validation of a trauma identification system using preselected tdi
   images; (b) design evaluation by experts; and (c) usability evaluation
   measured by the reporting of three fictitious tdi cases and using the
   system usability scale (sus). results in the first phase, 182
   participants participated. most images showed over 95\% accuracy,
   indicating that they adequately represented the type of dentoalveolar
   trauma being evaluated (kappa = 0.75). the design evaluation identified
   nine usability problems-four of them with a ``high priority{''} to be
   fixed, four with ``low priority,{''} and one ``no fix necessary.{''} a
   total of 29 volunteers participated in the usability evaluation. the
   mean time for users to complete all of the reports was 7.8 +/- 3.0
   minutes. mean sus score was 67.4 +/- 21.9 (range: 0-100; worst to best).
   the global agreement between cases registered with the gold standard was
   also ``substantial{''} (kappa = 0.71). conclusions this preliminary
   evaluation confirmed the app's usability, using a sample of potential
   users, as well as reporting on the results of an expert panel review of
   the dtt. these are the minimum requirements necessary before further

  abstract       = {{background: studies have consistently shown that mobile and web-based
   apps have positive impacts on people's daily lifestyles, health
   management, and disease treatment. as the development of medical and
   health informatization in china has evolved, different kinds of
   mobile-based apps for individuals and hospitals have been developed by
   software vendors. however, doubts and challenges posed by the media have
   prevented these apps from having a stable and substantial user base.
   analyses of user requirements have not typically been performed prior to
   the design of such mobile apps. the health information government
   authority in liaoning province, china, was planning to establish a
   mobile health (mhealth)-based health management platform, aiming to
   alleviate the difficulties citizens have in seeking hospital services.
   objective: the goal of this study was to determine the actual health and
   medical needs of citizens that may be addressed by medical information
   technologies. the results may contribute to the functional design and
   development of health management and appointed treatment-oriented mobile
   apps.
   methods: in this study, a semi-structured questionnaire on mhealth
   requirements was designed and tested, and 240 questionnaires were given
   to the outpatients of the first hospital of the china medical university
   in shenyang, liaoning province, china; of these, 228 valid responses
   were collected, for a response rate of 95\%. we discussed the current
   development of mhealth with 50 related experts and engineers from health
   authorities and a medical information company. spss 13.0 was used for
   statistical analyses.
   results: after detailed analyses of the questionnaire data, several
   findings were evident: first, most citizens and patients were unclear
   about their health conditions (64.5\%, 147/228) and were interested in
   receiving a mobile app as a tool to manage their health and medical
   needs (71.1\%, 162/228). patients in different outpatient departments
   had different opinions regarding online registration. conversely, the
   main problems for outpatients were long waiting times (66.4\%, 148/223)
   and difficulties in making appointments (46.5\%, 106/228), and they also
   worried about payments and internet problems when using a mobile app for
   appointment reservations. furthermore, as the main service target of
   mhealth is the health management of the general population, we first
   need to solve the associated interoperability and data security problems
   associated with such apps.
   conclusions: this study provides insight into the health and medical
   requirements of smartphone apps, and draws attention to some of the
   challenges and opportunities of mhealth. we suggest several value-added
   features and characteristics that app developers should take into
   consideration when developing health and medical-related apps. the
   findings also highlight some major challenges that require further
   consideration and research to ensure that these apps meet the core needs
   of patients and aid the development of the health information system in
   liaoning province, china.}},

   finally, the ptfs are checked on the control flow graph (cfg) to acquire

   device-to-device (d2d) interface. under this environment, the
   traditional dash on each device may compete the scarce mobile bandwidth
   to download the same and redundant video contents. in this paper, we
   propose a d2d dash framework to promote cooperation among devices, while
   enhancing video quality of service. the video content server collects
   status of each mobile device and determines the appropriate bitrate to
   it, while the mobile device downloads the video fragments and then
   shares with other mobile devices by d2d communication. in order to save
   energy while still maintaining video quality, the cluster of mobile
   devices are divided into super node and peer node, and where only super
   nodes fulfill the video downloading via expensive cellular networks and
   then share with others through wifi broadcasting. we implement the
   proposed system on an android testbed, and illustrate its efficient
   performance by real implementation. experimental results demonstrate
   that the bitrate selection algorithm can reduce energy consumption up to
   25 \% and meanwhile maintain competitive video quality.}},

   vaspy embodies a machine learning model that learns suitable attacking
   times to prevent the attack from being noticed by the user. we implement
   a proof-of-concept spyware and test it on a range of popular android
   phones. the experimental results demonstrate that this approach can

   signal strength (rss) during the fingerprint positioning process
   generally varies due to the dissimilar hardware configurations of
   heterogeneous smartphones. this difference may degrade the accuracy of
   fingerprint matching between fingerprint and test data. thus, this paper
   puts forward a fingerprint method based on grey relational analysis
   (gra) to approach the challenge of heterogeneous smartphones and to
   improve positioning accuracy. initially, the grey relational coefficient
   (grc) between the rss comparability sequence of each reference point
   (rp) and the rss reference sequence of the test point (tp) is
   calculated. subsequently, the grey relational degree (grd) between each
   rp and tp is determined on the basis of grc, and the k most relational
   rps are selected in accordance with the value of grd. finally, the user
   location is determined by weighting the k most relational rps that
   correspond to the coordinates. the main advantage of this gra method is
   that it does not require device calibration when handling heterogeneous
   smartphone problems. we further carry out extensive experiments using
   heterogeneous android smartphones in an office environment to verify the

   application, which obtains three-axis acceleration, angular velocity,
   and gps with accurate sampling timing. however, the robustness and
   accuracy was limited. in this paper, the idrims was improved mainly by
   employing frequency domain analysis. the algorithm consists of two
   steps. first, a half car (hc) model was selected as the vehicle model,
   and vehicle parameters were identified through driving tests over a
   portable hump of known size. in contrast to the previous approach of
   parameter identification in the time domain using unscented kalman
   filter, the parameters were optimized to minimize the difference between
   the simulation and measured hump responses in the frequency domain,
   using a genetic algorithm. then, iri was estimated by measuring the
   vertical acceleration responses of ordinary vehicles. the measured
   acceleration was converted into the acceleration root mean square (rms)
   of the sprung mass of a standard quarter car (qc) by multiplying a
   transfer function. the transfer function, estimated through the
   simulation of the identified hc model, as opposed to qc model in
   previous approaches, reflected the vehicle pitching motions and sensor
   installation location. the rms was further converted to iri based on the
   correlation between these values. numerical simulation was conducted to
   investigate the performance in terms of various driving speeds and
   sensor locations. the experiment was conducted at a 13 km road by
   comparing three types of vehicles and a profiler. inaccurate iri
   estimation at the speed change section was experimentally investigated
   and compensated. furthermore, the improved method was applied to 72
   vehicles that were driven more than 180,000 km per year. a data
   collection and analysis platform was built, which successfully collected

   performance from user's perspective. traditional performance profilers
   only focus on one kind of program activities (e.g., cpu profiling),
   while the cause for slow responsiveness is diverse or even due to the
   joint effect of multiple kinds. also, various test configurations, such
   as device hardware and wireless connectivity can have dramatic impact on
   particular program activities and indirectly affect app responsiveness.
   conventional mobile testing lacks mechanisms to reveal
   configuration-sensitive bugs. in this paper, we propose appspin, a tool
   to automatically diagnose app responsiveness bugs and systematically
   explore configuration-sensitive bugs. appspin instruments the app to
   collect program events and ui responsiveness. the instrumented app is
   exercised with automated monkey testers and appspin correlates excessive
   and lengthy program events with bad responsiveness detected at runtime.
   the diagnosis process also synthesizes the major resource bottleneck for
   the app. after one test run, appspin automatically alters the test
   configuration to with most bottlenecked resource to further explore
   responsiveness bugs happened only with particular test configurations.
   our preliminary experiments with 30 real-world apps show that appspin
   can detect 123 responsiveness bugs and successfully diagnose the cause
   for 87\% cases, within an average of 15-minute test time. also with
   altered test configurations, appspin uncovers a notable number of new

   question \& answer (q\&a) system that aims to provide mobile information
   seekers with timely, trustworthy and accurate answers while ensuring
   that information providers are not inappropriately burdened. we tackle
   this challenge by taking advantage of both static and dynamic context
   and semantics from mobile users (e.g., geolocation, social network,
   expertise/interest, device sensor profiles, battery level) to identify
   sources of information (i.e., workers) that are trusted by the user and
   accurate enough for the questions at hand. given a question, the
   smartsource broker middleware executes a scalable and efficient worker
   selection algorithm that uses a lyapunov optimization framework to
   maximize the utility of worker selection while guaranteeing the
   stability of the overall system. an associated assignor selection is
   used to scale the selection process to a large number of users. we
   implement the smartsource prototype system on an android testbed and
   thoroughly evaluate the system using real world applications and data,
   in particular those that involve geospatial questions and answers.
   evaluation results indicate that smartsource is efficient and provides
   superior worker selection compared to baseline approaches. smartsource
   is also highly customizable: it employs a general utility function and
   provides a control knob to tradeoff the optimality and responding time.
   we believe that smartsource will pave a way for new mechanisms of

  abstract          = {{during the rapid development cycle for internet products (websites and
   mobile apps), new features are developed and rolled out to users
   constantly. features with code defects or design flaws can cause outages
   and significant degradation of user experience. the traditional method
   of code review and change management can be time-consuming and
   error-prone. in order to make the feature rollout process safe and fast,
   this paper proposes a methodology for rolling out features in an
   automated way using an adaptive experimental design. under this
   framework, a feature is gradually ramped up from a small proportion of
   users to a larger population based on real-time evaluation of the
   performance of important metrics. if there are any regression detected
   during the ramp-up step, the ramp-up process stops and the feature
   developer is alerted. there are two main algorithm components powering
   this framework: 1) a continuous monitoring algorithm - using a variant
   of the sequential probability ratio test (sprt) to monitor the feature
   performance metrics and alert feature developers when a metric
   degradation is detected, 2) an automated ramp-up algorithm - deciding
   when and how to ramp up to the next stage with larger sample size. this
   paper presents one monitoring algorithm and three ramping up algorithms
   including time-based, power-based, and risk-based (a bayesian approach)
   schedules. these algorithms are evaluated and compared on both simulated
   data and real data. there are three benefits provided by this framework
   for feature rollout: 1) for defective features, it can detect the
   regression early and reduce negative effect, 2) for healthy features, it
   rolls out the feature quickly, 3) it reduces the need for manual
   intervention via the automation of the feature rollout process.}},

  abstract          = {{our society is highly dependent on mobile communications. however,
   coverage to mobile devices may be inadequate in a variety of
   infrastructure and outage circumstances. in particular, in disaster
   scenarios both victims and rescuers need network access to the outside
   world to aid in the search and rescue operation, while local wireless
   infrastructures may have been damaged. a hybrid mobile ad hoc network
   can be used to address this coverage problem without modifications to
   the existing wireless infrastructure. in this approach, a number of
   members called gateway nodes have connections to network infrastructure,
   capable of relaying data/information to destinations off of the manet.
   in this paper, we seek to improve the design of hybrid mobile ad hoc
   networks for extending wireless coverage in disaster search and rescue
   scenarios through the use of self-organized context-aware data
   forwarding, which utilizes the location and mobility context of mobile
   devices inferred from their built-in sensors to improve the performance.
   we are building an android application testbed that implements the
   hybrid manet across a number of mobile devices to assess different
   design choices. we also plan to perform analytical modeling and
   numerical simulations to evaluate this hybrid system on extending
   wireless coverage in disaster scenarios.}},

   questionnaire different groups have used different questionnaires for
   mhealth app usability evaluation: the commonly used questionnaires are
   the system usability scale (sus) and post-study system usability
   questionnaire (pssuq). however, the sus and pssuq were not designed to
   evaluate the usability of mhealth apps. self-written questionnaires are
   also commonly used for evaluation of mhealth app usability but they have
   not been validated.
   objective: the goal of this project was to develop and validate a new
   mhealth app usability questionnaire.
   methods: an mhealth app usability questionnaire (mauq) was designed by
   the research team based on a number of existing questionnaires used in
   previous mobile app usability studies, especially the well-validated
   questionnaires mauq, sus, and ps suq were then used to evaluate the
   usability of two mhealth apps: an interactive mhealth app and a
   standalone mhealth app. the reliability and validity of the new
   questionnaire were evaluated. the correlation coefficients among mauq,
   sus, and pssuq were calculated.
   results: in this study, 128 study participants provided responses to the
   questionnaire statements. psychometric analysis indicated that the mauq
   has three subscales and their internal consistency reliability is high.
   the relevant subscales correlated well with the subscales of the pssuq.
   the overall scale also strongly correlated with the pssuq and sus. four
   versions of the mauq were created in relation to the type of app
   (interactive or standalone) and target user of the app (patient or
   provider). a website has been created to make it convenient for mhealth
   app developers to use this new questionnaire in order to assess the

   great flexibility and portability. however, such advantages are
   challenged by the limited battery life of mobile devices. this paper
   presents cuckoo, a scheme of flexible compute-intensive task offloading
   in mcc for energy saving. cuckoo seeks to balance the key design goals:
   maximize energy saving (technical feasibility) and minimize the impact
   on user experience with limited cost for offloading (realistic
   feasibility). specifically, using a combination of static analysis and
   dynamic profiling, compute-intensive tasks are fine-grained marked from
   mobile application codes offline. according to the network transmission
   technologies supported in mobile devices and the runtime network
   conditions, adopting task-bundled strategy online offloads these tasks
   to mcc. in the task-hosted stage, we propose a skyline-based online
   resource scheduling strategy to satisfy the realistic feasibility of
   mcc. in addition, we adopt resource reservation to reduce the extra
   energy consumption caused by the task multi-offloading phenomenon.
   further, we evaluate the performance of cuckoo using real-life data sets
   on our mcc testbed. our extensive experiments demonstrate that cuckoo is
   able to balance energy consumption and execution performance. copyright

  abstract  = {{objective: the ability to use electronic medical records (emr) is an
   essential skill for surgical residents. however, frustration and anxiety
   surrounding emr tasks may detract from clinical performance. we created
   a series of brief, 1-3 minutes ``how to{''} videos demonstrating 7 key
   perioperative emr tasks: booking or cases, placing preprocedure orders,
   ordering negative-pressure wound dressing supplies, updating
   day-of-surgery history and physical notes, writing brief operative
   notes, discharging patients from the postanesthesia care unit, and
   checking vital signs. additionally, we used ``cutting insights{''}-a
   locally developed responsive mobile application for surgical trainee
   education-as a platform for providing interns with easy access to these
   videos. we hypothesized that exposure to these videos would lead to
   increased resident efficiency and confidence in performing essential
   perioperative tasks, ultimately leading to improved clinical
   performance.\& para;\& para;methods: eleven surgery interns participated
   in this initiative. before watching the ``how to{''} videos, each intern
   was timed performing the aforementioned 7 key perioperative emr tasks.
   they also underwent a simulated perioperative emergency requiring the
   performance of 3 of these emr tasks in conjunction with 5 other required
   interventions (including notifying the chief resident, the anesthesia
   team, and the or coordinator; and ordering fluid boluses, appropriate
   laboratories, and blood products). these simulations were scored on a
   scale from 0 to 8. the interns were then directed to watch the videos.
   two days later, their times for performing the 7 tasks and their scores
   for a similar perioperative emergency simulation were once again
   recorded. before and after watching the videos, participants were
   surveyed to assess their confidence in performing each emr task using a
   5-point likert scale. we also elicited their opinions of the videos and
   web-based mobile application using a 5-point scale. statistical analyses
   to assess for statistical significance (p <= 0.05) were conducted using
   paired t-test for parametric variables and a wilcoxon matched-pair test
   for nonparametric variables.\& para;\& para;setting: hospital of the
   university of pennsylvania, philadelphia, pa (a quaternary teaching
   hospital within the university of pennsylvania health system).
   \& para;\& para;participants: eleven out of 15 interns (12 entered and
   11 completed the study) from our categorical and preliminary general
   surgery residency programs during the 2016 academic year.\& para;\&
   para;results: before exposure to the brief ``how to{''} videos, 6 of 11
   interns were unable to complete all 7 emr tasks; after exposure, all 11
   interns were able to complete all 7 emr tasks. moreover, interns' times
   for each task improved following exposure. interns self-reported
   improved confidence in booking an or case (4 +/- 0.9 vs. 4.7 +/- 0.6, p
   = 0.05), ordering negative-pressure wound therapy supplies (3.1 +/- 1.6
   vs. 4.5 +/- 0.7, p < 0.05), writing a brief operative note (3.7 +/- 1.2
   vs. 4.6 +/- 0.7, p = 0.05), discharging patients from the postanesthesia
   care unit (3.3 +/- 1.0 vs. 4.4 +/- 0.8, p < 0.05), checking vital signs
   (2.5 +/- 1.4 vs. 4.5 +/- 0.8, p <= 0.01), and performing necessary emr
   tasks during an emergency situation (2.4 +/- 0.8 vs. 4.6 +/- 0.7, p <=
   0.0001). participants also demonstrated a significant improvement in
   average clinical score on the emergency simulations (5.2 +/- 1.7 vs. 6.6
   +/- 0.9, p < 0.05). interns' opinions of the videos and the mobile phone
   application were favorable.\& para;\& para;conclusions: in our group of
   11 surgery interns, exposure to a series of short ``how to{''} videos
   led to increased confidence and shortened times in performing 7
   essential emr tasks. additionally, during a simulated perioperative
   emergency, emr tasks were performed significantly faster. clinical
   performance also improved significantly following exposure to the
   videos. this just-in-time educational intervention could improve
   workflow efficiency and clinical performance, both of which may
   ultimately enhance perioperative patient safety. (c) 2017 published by

   also discover that many ble iot devices adopt ``just works{''} pairing,
   allowing attackers to actively connect with these devices if there is no
   app-level authentication. even worse, this vulnerability can also be
   directly uncovered from mobile apps. furthermore, we also identify that
   there is an alarming number of vulnerable app-level authentication apps,
   which means the devices connected by these apps can be directly
   controlled by attackers. to raise the public awareness of ble iot device
   fingerprinting and also uncover these vulnerable ble iot devices before
   attackers, we develop an automated mobile app analysis tool blescope and
   evaluate it with all of the free ble iot apps in google play store. our
   tool has identified 1,757 vulnerable mobile apps in total. we also
   performed a field test in a 1.28 square miles region, and identified 5,
   822 real ble devices, among them 5, 509 (94.6\%) are fingerprintable by
   attackers, and 431 (7.4\%) are vulnerable to unauthorized access. we
   have made responsible disclosures to the corresponding app developers,
   and also reported the fingerprinting issues to the bluetooth special
   interest group.}},
